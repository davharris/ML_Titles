ML_Titles
=========

I string words together from the titles of machine learning papers on ArXiv (http://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent).

The titles in the "data" folder were scraped by Philippe (@PhDP) and are available under a Creative Commons Share Alike license (some of them are CC-BY).

The transition matrix is in a [standard format](http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html#MMformat) as exported by `Matrix::writeMM`.
