=========

I string words together from the titles of scientific papers.

The machine learning titles in the "data" folder were scraped by Philippe (@PhDP) from ArXiv and are available under a Creative Commons Share Alike license (some of them are CC-BY).

The ecology titles were scraped from PLoS journals using [rplos](https://github.com/ropensci/rplos). These titles are all CC-BY.

The code is available under The Artistic License 2.0 (see `LICENSE`).

The transition matrices are in a [standard format](http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html#MMformat) as exported by `Matrix::writeMM`.
