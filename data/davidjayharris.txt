@vsbuffalo How does tomorrow sound?
@noamross For example, I have no idea why the last tweet ended with "the".  I don't seem to get that problem with the other titlebots.
@noamross titles of articles from their research "journal."  Very small corpus, so some odd behaviors. Still fun :-)
@vsbuffalo along the lines of your favorite bison-related sentence:
@mr_ino @mattmight what happens when the script sees this sentence?

This is good scientific coding advice as well. Bugs like this should terrify us. @avandeursen @brrian @michaelhoffman
@johnmyleswhite @RobbyMeals @Cmrn_DP Right. If someone's computer can run a bash script, it can probably run perl as well.
@johnmyleswhite @Cmrn_DP @RobbyMeals why require Julia, then?
Titlebot is back! Prepare for more domain-specific nonsense from @EcologyTitles and @ML_Titles.  Code here:

@skmorgane @duffy_ma word tends to do weird        things with         spacing even without stray spaces.
@skmorgane @duffy_ma if you accidentally put random     spaces in  your     document,        Word    will display   it     like       this

@noamross Fantastic. Is there a particular place for these docs?
@ErikaMudrak I always have trouble with direct messages.  Did mine go through? Short answer: one meta-account w/ one sub-account per site
@djhocking BTW I haven't forgotten that I owe you some citations.  I'll try to email them to you by this weekend.  Sorry for the delay!
@djhocking No idea.  Looks cool, but I'm *extremely* skeptical (a priori) that detection error can be estimated using single-visit surveys.
@cboettig Thanks!
@cboettig My GP doesn't go anywhere near 0,0. Could increase weight on that point, but worried about shifting mean fn
@graydon2 Best wishes!
@cboettig Could you point me to an example of conditioning a GP on a known value? Having trouble finding it in your repo.  Thanks!
@ucfagls @BobOHara Now I'm confused too.  Why would you expect confidence intervals to sum to anything in particular?
@BobOHara @ucfagls :-)
@algaebarnacle @rstudioapp That's no good.  I use those all the time on my mac.  Try posting for support on their website. Or reinstalling.
@ucfagls try coda::HPDinterval.
@ucfagls no problem. Glad to help.
@ucfagls pretty sure they'll be MVN asymptotically. Rows are IID, log-likelihoods add, CLT takes over.
@ucfagls highest posterior density interval is nice alternative to PCI for asymmetrical distributions.
@ucfagls pretty sure averaging %s from bootstrap samples will still sum to 1. Have you tried?
@ucfagls if sample size is small, posterior/bootstrap distribution won't be described all that well by rmse, but not the end of the world.
@ucfagls bootstrap CIs seem good to me. Might be able to approximate directly from your model with 'vcov' too. Would avoid needing 100 fits.
@ucfagls and y-hat is the normalized likelihood? Seems fine to me...
@ucfagls why are you squaring?
@ucfagls you can exponentiate the predictive log-likelihoods to get likelihoods and normalize so they sum to one. Now you have proportions.
Folks seem to like my @StackStats answer about information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC, WAIC, etc.)
@algaebarnacle @rstudioapp what differences do you encounter (apart from keyboard shortcuts)?
t is a mixture of Gaussians with different SDs. So maybe t process is like a mixture of GPs with different lengths? @_NickGolding_ @cboettig
.@StatMLPapers is blowing my mind. "Student-t Processes"  cc @_NickGolding_ @cboettig
@ucfagls Yeah.  Or sum up the observation-level deviances, assuming that your rows are iid.
@ucfagls why not deviance? Or am I missing something?
@phdpqc absolutely. The long term cost of skimping and getting bad translations could be astronomical.
@phdpqc could also have a few executive vice chief lord translators, who each need $50,000,000 plus a lavish expense account.
@phdpqc that actually sounds almost reasonable. 10k translators @ $150k each (including offices, equipment, training, etc) would do it.
@algaebarnacle I think @ucfagls and @cbahlai were just talking about this the other day.
Along the same lines as yesterday's paper via @StatMLPapers: Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
@_NickGolding_ @ucfagls Prior seems not to have affected results much, which is great.
@_NickGolding_ @ucfagls Just set the prior variance to 10^4 (effectively flat) and trying again.  Will let you know how it turns out.
e.g. @_NickGolding_'s package plows through my bird data in &lt;1 hour. Boosted trees took 15. Likelihood is about 30x better out-of-sample too
@_NickGolding_ @ucfagls mgcv uses "generalized" CV, which is an AIC-like penalty.
@_NickGolding_ @ucfagls In that case, well done picking a good prior.
@_NickGolding_ @ucfagls Remind me.  Where does that prior come from?
@ucfagls @_NickGolding_ Yeah.  DIC, if I remember correctly.
@_NickGolding_ BTW, I already find it pretty snappy for my data (N = 1600, p = 8).  Especially since I don't have to cross-validate.
@_NickGolding_ If you ever want to tackle multiple species, please let me know. I'd love to collaborate.
... does its own tuning so you don't need to spend time cross-validating. Well done @_NickGolding_!  Link:  2/2

@Mattcademia @Mchl_Wolfe @ucfagls can you point to an example where curated data was deemed copyrightable in the US?
@michaelhoffman @hylopsar @dgmacarthur @algaebarnacle @jtleek good frequency properties too. Controlling false discovery rate is useful 2/2
@michaelhoffman @hylopsar @dgmacarthur @algaebarnacle @jtleek saying "everyone wants posteriors" is too sweeping. Methods need ... 1/2
@ZachWeiner @brianwolven 1 mole of water takes up 1.8 m^3 (based on density of 1). Should be able to calculate from that?
@ZachWeiner @brianwolven Looks like it's the distance between H nucleus and O nucleus.   Is that what you wanted?
@phdpqc err, forgot to link. Applies to both of these, actually.    thanks again for comments!
@phdpqc on the positive side, I'm really happy with the methods in this file. All are short and have descriptive names. Feels very clean.
@phdpqc ah, right. Maybe I was accidentally overwriting in another function and superstitiously made copies in this one, just to be safe &gt;.&lt;
@algaegirl328 community college makes much more sense for a lot of people. More teaching focus and much cheaper!
@phdpqc thanks! I feel good about it overall, but I don't have a good interface yet. Too many choices and hyperparameters!
@phdpqc I thought C++ always passed by reference?
@phdpqc more likely to be my ignorance of C++. I didn't want to alter the original matrix, so I modified a copy.
Do #climatechange GCMs include any form of uncertainty *within* scenarios like A2?
@MRHelmus @JeremyJBerg Just found this new paper/R package for phylogenetic regression. Possibly relevant.

@algaebarnacle Yup.  Given a choice between mutilating their data and choosing a non-Gaussian error function, people make strange decisions.
@algaebarnacle Binomial/multinomial make sense if data is rounded. Dirichlet is like beta but generalized for more than 2 cover classes.
@algaebarnacle I've thought a bit about this. Depending on the context, I'd do mixtures of betas, binomials, Dirichlets, or multinomials.
@_NickGolding_ nice! Glad I could help
@seanjtaylor @killerswan @johnmyleswhite Upon further reading, it looks trickier. Adjectives and verbs show up too, just not grammatically.
@seanjtaylor @killerswan @johnmyleswhite Shouldn't be hard, right? Find a corpus, pull out some nouns, and add much/so/wow.
Looks interesting, especially Figure 4: On the Number of Linear Regions of Deep Neural Networks  via @StatMLPapers
@karpathy Right. But as far as I know, none of those had the Deep Learning™ brand and all of them were pretty specialized.
@karpathy yeah, that's much more reasonable.
@karpathy is there any possible way an informed, objective observer could claim that deep learning "started at Microsoft"?
@_NickGolding_ @TAlexPerkins PostGIS could probably do it. Alternatively, try simplifying the polygon first.

@skmorgane @ethanwhite fixed effect for rodent removal and random effects for day, period, and plot. Binomial errors w/ N=45. 3/3

@skmorgane @ethanwhite not sure this is a *good* way to fit the model, but I fixed sine wave w/ annual period and had one do 1/n
@_NickGolding_  Oh. Maybe I should match your terminology. I'll see what I can do. Still deciding on a journal.
@skmorgane Made a little model of Portal rodent captures over time. Erica knows her metadata!

@larysar @ucfagls Thanks guys!
@ucfagls This seems to give the same result I get from averaging R^2 across 14 bivariate linear models.
@ucfagls Thanks! Think this will work.  To clarify, you're suggesting `rda(full ~ summary)` &amp; reporting constrained proportion of inertia?
@larysar Good idea, but I don't see anything like R^2 on that page or in ?CCA::cc
@larysar I have two dimensions that are of interest a priori &amp; don't align with the original 14.
I have a 14-dimensional matrix and a 2D summary of it. How do I compute % variance captured by my summary? Manova? Manually? Something else?

@djhocking It's pretty typical, I think? If it bothers you, you might be able to address the issue by putting a weak prior on beta.
@_NickGolding_ @ucfagls Depending on how you're planning on using the matrix, databases could be an option too.  Can even query them from R.
@jennschiffer stupid autocorrect. Should say "for what it's worth..."
@jennschiffer forebear it's worth, I just discovered your humor last night and really enjoyed it. Sorry about the jackasses on the bus.
@_NickGolding_ avoid reading it all into R at once. More seriously, consider compressing and/or storing in an optimized binary format.

Crazy idea for defending against an obvious software patents 1/N  (disclaimer: I'm this is not legal advice and is probably a terrible idea)
@ucfagls Yeah. As I said, I do understand the reasoning. I'm sure Google did try to engineer around it and just couldn't. Sad.
@ucfagls Worth noting b/c 3x damages for willfulness usually involves copying. I do understand reasoning for applying 3x here, but holy cow.
@ucfagls AFAICT, *any* algorithm that used the obvious factors to affect ad placement (e.g. minimum bid, expected click rate) would infringe

@DistribEcology I almost posted a reply about that without noticing that it was by Borowitz, who writes satire. @NewYorker
@skmorgane thanks! It's not fully spatial either, unfortunately. Spatial autocorrelation is tricky too.
@skmorgane not without significant assumptions (like in most SDM predictions) or modification to the code to handle time series.
@weecology @skmorgane It's no very mechanistic, but it does give some insight into mechanism. Link:

@enterthesloth @ecostats @ecologician @pveski Also, @MRHelmus has done some similar work in a phylogenetic context.
@ecostats Cool.  I have a model for that too, but was rejected from PNAS. Not sure when I'll have time to revive it, but we should talk.

@cbahlai @ethanwhite @RobLanfear I don't think copyright is the tool for those jobs. Ditto for personal medical info in other fields.
@cbahlai @ethanwhite @RobLanfear *maybe* unreleased data can be a trade secret in some contexts? But that seems counter to science.
@cbahlai @ethanwhite @RobLanfear that's debatable. If data==facts, then copyright doesn't apply. Patents, trademarks don't apply either.
@ethanwhite @RobLanfear @cbahlai Neither of those things is obvious. Copyright does not protect "facts". Most scientists don't want to sue.

@ucfagls @noamross @mbeisen Using `image` and calling the result a quilt plot isn't wrong, but their characterization of heat maps is.
@ucfagls @noamross @mbeisen Disagree. The paper is actually *erroneous* in terms of how it defines heat maps.
@ucfagls @jslefche Not sure I understand.  Infinite series are pretty standard:
@jslefche Only if you use an odd definition of "=". Nice analogy here:

@johnmyleswhite @hunter_owens Why?
@scisus thanks! Looking forward to catching up next week. Appreciate all your feedback!
@kite_africa @kara_woo thanks!
@GrrlScientist @BobOHara @_NickGolding_ @KristenDybala @hpj28 @srsupp @ErikaMudrak Thanks all! Really appreciate it.
@hylopsar thanks!
@mickresearch @algaebarnacle thanks!
@vsbuffalo @ethanwhite thanks!
.@jennomics thanks! Really enjoyed your lab meeting :-)
.@cboettig won the #ASN2014 award for best postdoc talk! Congratulations Carl!
I won the #ASN2014 award for best student poster! See it on @figshare here:
@noamross Friday or Monday would be better, I think. Need to catch up.
@noamross @jaimedash @ucfagls do you need a global optimum? Might be NP-complete or something.

@jennomics perfect! Are you free on Monday?
Don't forget, you can still see the posters the afternoon coffee break at #ASN2014.  Or download mine from
@ucfagls dunno, that could be the issue. Wasn't clear on a point a speaker was trying to make.
#ASN2014 if I'm interested in the assemblages on an island, what *exactly* am I missing if I ignore mainland spp? Will my results be biased?

@algaebarnacle I'm not sure how you can evenly aggregate a 5x5. Different cells would have different number or subplots, right? 5 is prime
@algaebarnacle define grid data?
@larysar Good question. No idea. Potentially need fewer data points if have more species, but haven't tested it yet.
@BobOHara thanks. Won't be able to make it, unfortunately.
@kara_woo As @hspter probably remembers, I bailed after the first disk. Too much awkward, awkward, awkward sex for me :-/
@mickresearch actually, it's worse than that. Mean is something like 12%, but j think median is less than 5%
@mickresearch a typical species shows up 12% of the time. The prob of getting 90 in the same place is a priori very low.
@mickresearch here's the corresponding graph for my model. R^2 is slightly higher, and CI's are almost correct. thx!
@DanMcGlinn also, thanks for your comments! :-)
@DanMcGlinn my cov matrices change w/ environment, but mine seem to be + on average from what I've seen. Very fat tails, so lots of "-" too
@DanMcGlinn not sure I fully understand your question. + means more variance in richness for the group (all or none).
@ZachWeiner In more concrete terms, they get copyright on the paper and can send C&amp;D notices to scientists trying to spread their own work.
@ZachWeiner because journals have convinced the system that their contribution outweighs the scientific contribution. 1/2
Also: "No school would provide landing space for a student's fighter jet, or condone the disruption the jet's use would cause." 3/3
... evinces an improbably insouciant attitude toward the relative difficulty and danger of piloting a fighter plane in a residential area."
Sentence of the day, via  "The teenager's comment that flying a Harrier Jet to school 'sure beats the bus'..." 1/3
Why doesn't @figshare let me use my middle name?
@noamross I changed a bunch after the initial upload though :-/
Current status: praying to the typo gods I didn't just pay for printing a poster with an error. #ASN2014
Final version of #ASN2014 poster: "Predicting species composition when environmental drivers are missing"  Thanks all!
@lizhmartin Thanks! @mickresearch
@_NickGolding_ @BobOHara @mickresearch Thanks again for comments. BTW, updated poster to say "current *nonlinear* methods can't...."
@Graham_Coop did you just thank yourself?
@mickresearch Okay, no room  for extra figure, but do say this now:   # outside 95% CI (red/blue Xs) dropped from 50% to 10%.  Thanks again.
@BobOHara thanks again!
@mickresearch @lizhmartin nothing comes to mind. Most papers don't even bother with CIs, so precision could be *anything*
@mickresearch good point! I should print a copy of that graph and keep it on hand. My 95% CI has 90% of obs. Not ideal, but better than 47%
@BobOHara Not much I can do about that at this point. I'll try to be more specific in the paper. Thanks again.
@BobOHara "... could help inform researchers about biological mechanisms in systems where data and expert knowledge are scarce." Better? thx
@ucfagls nothing spatial, unfortunately. Couldn't get good samples quickly last time I tried.  I just meant unit variance, zero covariances.
@BobOHara @MethodsEcolEvol Was leaning towards Ecological Applications for this one . What do you think?
@_NickGolding_ heard someone mention it once, in passing. Really should learn Python...
@_NickGolding_ Near the bottom of mine as well. GPs would be *great* but I'm happy with stochastic neural nets for now.  @BobOHara @cboettig
@BobOHara @ecostats Ooh, excellent. I'd love to hear what you come up with.
@BobOHara Yep.  They're the white boxes on the left hand side of my flowcharts. I used climate (Worldclim) as my predictors.
@BobOHara @_NickGolding_ Definitely a valid point.
@_NickGolding_ @BobOHara Not that hacks are always bad.  But need to be up-front that model structure doesn't match inferences.
@_NickGolding_ @BobOHara these models have no causal pathways between species, full stop. Using them to describe competition is a hack. 2/2
@_NickGolding_ @BobOHara 2 distinct issues. "True" source of correlation is an empirical question, and could depend on scale. But... 1/2
@_NickGolding_ @BobOHara That would be wonderful.  @cboettig and I are both excited to see something like that happen.
@BobOHara I think reducing matrix size is crucial. Full-rank is tough and might only be 1-20 principal components worth considering anyway.
@BobOHara Thanks! Appreciate your feedback. I'll see what I can do before printing tomorrow.
3) I disagree that these models are well-suited to describe spp. interactions. Really describe latent factors.  @BobOHara @_NickGolding_ 5/5
2) Existing models assume (generalized) linear responses to environment. Sacrifices advances of modern SDMs. @BobOHara @_NickGolding_ 4/n
(70k params isn't so bad by itself, but need to store all of them for each MCMC iteration!) @BobOHara @_NickGolding_ 3/n
1) Full-rank cov matrix for 368 spp is computationally &amp; statistically intractable. Estimate &amp; store 70k params! @BobOHara @_NickGolding_
.@BobOHara I found a few major differences between my approach versus Bayesian approaches by @_NickGolding_ etc. 1/n
@BobOHara Yeah, I cite @_NickGolding_ &amp; Kissling et al. &amp; Ovaskainen et al. &amp; Clark et al. in the manuscript. No room on the poster :-(
@_NickGolding_Yeah, just like any other SDM.  In bottom-center panel, the arrow starts at prediction w/ no bird data at all.
@ucfagls details of prior aren't so important, as it gets heavily transformed by the neural net. Outputs don't have any dist in particular
@ucfagls thanks! Good question. Prior on Z is isotopic Gaussian; posterior depends on assemblage, like in warbler example.
Hi folks! I just posted my #ASN2014 poster on @figshare. Your comments would be very helpful before I print it.
@algaebarnacle @Radiolab Even more impressive:
Dear PowerPoint. Please don't assume I want to spend time figuring out what "glow" is and how to turn it off. Just use the colors I ask for.
@InsectEcology Saw the movie, but didn't read it.  WWZ (the book) is a thoughtful "oral history" of the plague, from years after the fact.
@_NickGolding_ @phdpqc Discussion here:
@_NickGolding_ @phdpqc Random search works surprisingly well and is about as simple as it gets. Nelder-Mead can be okay, too, maybe.
@InsectEcology I *really* liked the book, but...
@EvoEcoAmy @tpoi @phdpqc see also my tweets from last night for some quick analysis &amp; @EcologyTitles for title mash ups.
@EvoEcoAmy @tpoi @phdpqc 10k ecology-related titles from PLOS journals:  1/2
@phdpqc I'm revoking the oauth tokens until we figure out what's going on.  Don't want to pollute everyone's feeds *too* much!

against the wall and hoping something sticks.  I think the field is ready for another breakthrough as soon as someone can... 2/3 @karpathy
Playing with @karpathy's 1-D neural net really drives home how *redundant* most neurons are. Making nets big feels like throwing stuff 1/n
@hylopsar I haven't seen one.  Seems like it would be straightforward to implement in a BUGS-like language, though (e.g. JAGS/Stan).
.@phdpqc @tpoi Relevant: did you see this thing on the semantic meaning of periods in short messages?
To clarify, these are the top 10 words after removing "stop words" like "of" and "and", as listed here:
Top 10 words in @EcologyTitles form a sentence: "species diversity effects population genetic analysis using marine plant patterns" (1/2)
@tpoi @phdpqc Awesome. Sounds like it could be a fun addition.
@phdpqc @tpoi And if I remove "stop words" (like "a", and "of"), then "patterns" is #10.  More common than "environmental" or "ecological"!
@phdpqc @tpoi Can confirm.  In my list of 10,000 titles, "pattern" and "structure" are both in the 25 most-used words.
@phdpqc Your inaugural tweet with @EcologyTitles is probably one of the best yet! Nice work.
If I apply the fix from 6+ years ago, I may risk breaking other stuff. How has this not been patched in #python 2.6 or 2.7 or (2.71-2.75)?
All attempts to learn about the problem online point me to that ancient blog post telling me to manually rewrite code I don't understand.
To elaborate, I downloaded the latest Anaconda installation and get "ImportError: No module named _bsddb" on the first script I tried to run
More dependency nonsense keeping me from using #Python. Known issue for *six years* still requires user patches.
@djhocking @jessicablois @thelabandfield @algaebarnacle could be big benefits though.
@djhocking @jessicablois @thelabandfield @algaebarnacle seems like that's asking a lot of the model. Might even depend on species &amp; observer
@djhocking @jessicablois @thelabandfield @algaebarnacle Sure, but how reliably can any human count 836 Starlings in 3 min w/ divided attn?
@djhocking @jessicablois @thelabandfield @algaebarnacle BBS birders are pretty excellent. But their task might exceed human capabilities.
.@algaebarnacle @jessicablois @thelabandfield Cool. Abund can have lots more info, if data is reliable &amp; stats can deal with overdispersion.
@tpoi  &amp;  Other options here:
.@jessicablois @thelabandfield @algaebarnacle I worry about abundance data quality. What if you're counting ducks and 1000 starlings fly by?
@karpathy I enjoyed looking at it. Sensitivity above middle of animals' backs seemed to show that it's looking for horse riders, for example
@karpathy  Ah, very nice.  Is hue meaningful as well?
@karpathy in your CIFAR-10 convnet.js example, what does the second block of input activations describe? (see image)
.@algaebarnacle for the most part, my "student" status is just a bureaucratic fiction that makes me more expensive to hire than a postdoc.
@algaebarnacle me too. I'm actually pretty weirded out by the whole idea.
@kara_woo @algaebarnacle @kaggle ... forgot the link:
@kara_woo @algaebarnacle Related @Kaggle contest: optimize packing 10^6 presents into Santa's sleigh. Hope your move goes more smoothly!
@karpathy Side projects are important. I also had an unreasonable amount of fun on my (far simpler) winter break toy
@karpathy Wow.  Nice work!
@noamross Glad to hear it!
.@noamross I think that @ML_Titles has a much higher "hit rate" for good ideas than @EcologyTitles, unfortunately. @duffy_ma
MT @duffy_ma: @EcologyTitles is an excellent example for why "no one has ever studied X" is not a sufficient reason to do a study! @noamross
.@noamross "boat noise affects larval tolerance of tiger (panthera uncia) in daphnia magna".  Delightful work, @EcologyTitles! 3/3
... A nice side-effect of this is that @EcologyTitles usually gets genus names right. A nice example of this in the README... @noamross 2/3
.@noamross Every pair of neighboring words in @ML_Titles and @EcologyTitles must have occurred at least once in a real title. 1/2
@MLrecruiting4MS ... but I suspect something like @IBMWatson might actually be able to answer the hurdle question used in the video clip 2/2
@MLrecruiting4MS Video cut out halfway through for me.  I've read some of Marcus' recent perspectives and think he has good points 1/2
@simplystats would be interesting to compare with the relaxed lasso. Could separate shrinkage from selection somewhat
The characters in @edwrobertson’s novels are terrible ornithologists. The books are pretty good otherwise, though.

@jwoodgett @michaelhoffman I'm holding out for a comeback of the "ologies"
@ucfagls @recology_ @thelabandfield agreed. Whole point is that USA is supposed to have higher standards.
@stevelosh @michaelhoffman how does 418 fit into this?
@nxthompson @graydon2 Take that with a big grain of salt. "B vitamins" can't be at the bottom if folic acid is at the top: Folic acid is B9.

@ucfagls @noamross or just minimize the KL divergence between the negative binomial and the predicted frequencies.
@ucfagls @noamross why not just collect 10000 samples from the distribution? Then N will be known.
@noamross you might need to make N a parameter. If so, a prior on N would help identifiability. Could probably do it in a BUGS dialect
.@zentree I also find the distinction blurs sometimes. If I put a posterior distribution on just one variable, does that make me Bayesian?
.@zentree eg regularizing constraints/penalties vs priors or bootstrapping distributions versus posterior distributions.
.@zentree I mostly agree. Most methods from one camp have an alternative approach or interpretation that’s “respectable” from the other view

@RELenski Thanks.  Good food for thought.
I have a neat "bonus" result from my analyses. P&lt;0.01, but it only explains 2.2% of the variance.  Should I still include it in the paper?
@hormiga My back-of-the envelope calculation says not to reject the null unless more than about 1/3 CAREER awards go to undergrad schools
@Graham_Coop @lpachter On the other hand, multiplied by the number of students, that sort of error might start to add up.
@Graham_Coop @lpachter If student takes 50 classes, that's the difference between a 3.000 and a 3.003.
@Graham_Coop @lpachter Rounding to nearest letter grade affects GPA for class by 0.15 at most.  Divided by # of classes, is not a big deal.

@johnmyleswhite hmm. Okay. Thanks.
@johnmyleswhite if you find good references for this, I hope you'll let me know.
@johnmyleswhite I use mean when I can get it, and otherwise use mode. If data is super skewed, I use median. No real basis for this, though.
@johnmyleswhite err.. I meant that it's like using posterior *mean* instead of posterior *mode*. Usually doesn't increase bias much, either.
@johnmyleswhite using posterior mode instead of posterior mean, which can have less variance.  See e.g.
@johnmyleswhite I've played with it a bit.  Seems like a really nice way to reduce variance if CPU isn't limiting. Has a relationship to 1/2
@johnmyleswhite how do you feel about bagging these days?
@phdpqc There are some bells and whistles here that might be fun to add some day too:
@phdpqc @ML_Titles Good point.  BTW, how would you feel about automating the account somehow? I don't have the skills or the server.
@ashk4n @matthew_d_green How hard can this be to design? If sensor gets power, so does the light. End of story. Could this be intentional?
@phdpqc A bigram model could probably do it. Haven't figured out how to scrape the titles, though.

@_NickGolding_ @BobOHara @ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology got it. Thanks.
@BobOHara @ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology even if you have a prior that isn't flat?
@ucfagls might be better to ask @_NickGolding_. Figuring out GPs was hard for me. No one source really "clicked."
@BobOHara @ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology could you clarify stationarity?
@ucfagls I meant you could get 0.6
@ucfagls actually can give novel Yhat: number of possible predictions from an RF can exceed num observed Y.
@BobOHara @ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology I like GP approach:   Can specify prior, too which is nice.
@ucfagls if extrapolating, data never determine the outcome by definition. One rule is linear extrap; another is quadratic; this is flat
@sjGoring @ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology I mean outside full range of X, predictions will stop changing as X increases.
@ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology example tree: if x&gt;2, return .9; else return .4  Doesn't say anything about edges of data set
@ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology just predict on a bigger value than found in data set. Prediction surface is flat
@ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology I like Gaussian process approach: when far from data, increase uncertainty &amp; revert to prior.
@ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology assuming linear (or worse, quadratic) can make extremely strong predictions *way* outside data
@ucfagls @srsupp @BlasMBenito @InsectEcology in more concrete terms, predictions are flat outside data range. Not bad, just different. 1/2
.@srsupp and never quite got around to figuring out what mapply was for.
.@srsupp I use l/s/vapply for most things; apply for arrays; plyr for anything with splitting up groups of items. Don't like tapply.
.@srsupp I generally use _apply unless there's a reason not to. #rstats
.@srsupp Other hand: loops can do things _apply can't (e.g. if iteration 2 depends on iteration 1). Also, _apply *is* just a loop anyway.
.@srsupp Badly-done loops can be much slower #rstats. _apply usually won't affect global environment (no side effects), which can be safer.

@jaimedash @JeremyJBerg @ucfagls @james_gilbert thanks everyone! Hadn’t thought to specify “species richness”. Feels clearer now.
Question: do I need to define "richness" (i.e. total number of species observed) if my audience is mostly ecologists?

Here's a paper on the radon analyses from @StatModeling that I wrote about yesterday.  Looking forward to reading it!
@vsbuffalo @ryneches @christoper_hamm @Graham_Coop Illustrates the fine line 23AM has to walk to stay legal without regulation.
@vsbuffalo @ryneches @christoper_hamm @Graham_Coop worth noting: took &lt;10 minutes for convo to go from "it's a toy" to "better than an MD"
@ryneches @christoper_hamm @Graham_Coop Their marketing indicates otherwise.
@ryneches @christoper_hamm @Graham_Coop My recollection is that .@vsbuffalo was pretty concerned about their error rates a few weeks ago.
@ryneches @christoper_hamm @Graham_Coop Which means they're providing *even more* numbers that haven't actually been vetted.
@ryneches 2) Would you make that argument if a home pregnancy kit or thermometer refused to undergo testing? @christoper_hamm @Graham_Coop
@ryneches 1) Without the studies 23AM refused to do, we don't know *how reliable* the information is.  @christoper_hamm @Graham_Coop
.@ryneches @Graham_Coop @christoper_hamm ... regulated, it seems like this should be as well. Don't want error-prone tests on the market 3/3
.@ryneches @Graham_Coop @christoper_hamm ... just reporting facts, but also interpreted. If drugstore thermometers &amp; pregnancy tests are 2/3

"The implied dollar value per [Canadian or Swedish] microlife is lower [for radon] than ordinarily assumed for other risks"
... optimizes both personal and policy-level decisions given all the uncertainty and information. Very relevant for lots of fields 2/2
The Radon example is great because it works through a multi-step decision problem with uncertainty, uses multiple sources of info, and 1/2
I'm loving the Radon example in @StatModeling's book: "Bayesian Data Analysis". Favorite part of the book so far (been reading out of order)
@djhocking @QuantEcologyABC may make more sense given that obs level actually groups multiple coin flips in beta-binomial models.
@CjBayesian Step 1: assign everyone a unique 33-digit binary ID. Step 2: ask people one question about each digit.
@CjBayesian That indicates that they'll need many more than 33 questions in practice. Still a neat idea! 2/2
@CjBayesian They already failed the independence criterion in the first 2 questions: gender isn't 50-50 in the countries they listed. 1/2
@djhocking @QuantEcologyABC are "residuals" even that meaningful for non-Gaussian outcomes?

@djhocking very good news, then. If your autocorr is low enough, I'd feel good about combining runs. A lot of this is black magic, though.
@djhocking I'd take that as a good sign, especially if the chains started in very different areas before burn-in.
@djhocking also depends on where you start your chains. If all 10 start from diff areas with high posterior prob, that would help I think
@djhocking if the chains mix quickly enough, both options will give you lots of independent samples. If strong autocorr, need longer runs.
@djhocking only if the mixing time is short enough.

@phdpqc I think that all criminal trials and many civil trials have juries here unless both sides agree to waive that option. Not sure.
Plaintiff also didn't have a very good lawyer or very good documentation of facts. If you're gonna file a lawsuit, you need to be prepared.
Trial over. Plaintiff should have settled years ago. Wasted everyone's time and probably got less than she would have gotten out of court.
@ethanwhite @srsupp @figshare don't forget to tell Clark that his Eco Apps preprint is awesome!
@djhocking you might be able to solve the identifiability issue by putting different priors on the different discrete values?
@djhocking could it be an identifiability issue with your discrete mixture components? Often arbitrary which component is which.

@sarcozona Sorry :-(   You should definitely send me your snail mail address so I can send you cookies then. Let me know how else to help.
@johnmyleswhite Absolutely. Or nearly fixed, anyway. But it's everywhere in #Rstats. Makes it hard to estimate how long things will take.
Weird #Rstats "feature": vectorized functions only take 2x as long if you run them on 10x as many values: much less overhead per value
#Rstats computational overhead often exceeds the amount of computation (in C/C++) that I actually need to do. But it still saves me dev time
@wcwetzel @jaimedash ok, then I think you're good. I'll try to dig up a couple more references you may find useful.
@jaimedash @wcwetzel In short, I'd run a quick test with random data that has big variation among species as a control.
@jaimedash @wcwetzel similarity doesn't depends on a nonlinear function of prevalence, which I called p*. May be analogue in your case 2/2

@QuantEcologyABC @djhocking I think there's a theorem about it being net beneficial for very large sample sizes starting around 3 levels...
@JeromyAnglim This is largely fixed in iOS 7.0.3.
@ucfagls @hadleywickham ended up using aggregate instead. Probably should have done it manually, in retrospect.
@algaebarnacle @llthurman I haven't. List of invited speakers looks good. Don't think I can go to France for it though.
What on earth am I supposed to do with this object that `by` spat out? Thanks God for @hadleywickham.
plyr has problems on my machine (probably my fault), so I used `by` instead. Had forgotten what life was like before ddply! @hadleywickham
@wcwetzel my paper is about presence-absence dissimilarity, but could probably extend to abundance.  Might be better to simulate, though.
@mxwlj I think @MRHelmus will know
@wcwetzel I have a mildly related paper if you're looking at beta with dissimilarity measures:
@djhocking @QuantEcologyABC with 3 levels, I'd treat it as a fixed effect. Too little information on var. Dunno about half Cauchy in Jags.

@ucfagls @larysar @ftmaestre that would still imply a negative 2nd derivative. Does the paper make a big deal about left tail in particular?

Interesting @kaggle competition: inferring initial conditions in a deterministic spatial model.
@scisus Their results are probably bogus.  See discussion:
@BlasMBenito yeah. If models still correlate that well after two rounds of thresholding, the underlying correlation must have been strong
@frod_san @ecolandlab Some quick testing shows correlation might have been about 0.9 before thresholding!
@frod_san @ecolandlab ... Got correlations above 0.7. That's some serious robustness, if anything.
@frod_san @ecolandlab disagree. Can't conclude anything. They didn't even use the same threshold for different data sources &amp; still... 1/2
@frod_san @ecolandlab Why would anyone throw out so much information so haphazardly? And then expect consistent results?
@frod_san @ecolandlab They actually applied thresholds *twice* in their methods! Once for each model and then again for the ensemble!
@frod_san @ecolandlab Looks like their methods could be at fault. Thresholding could be fatal even if actual predictions were similar

@heathborders @vsbuffalo @StealthMountain good point
It's 2013. Why does @ESA_org require figures at the back with captions on a separate page? Big pain for both authors and reviewers.
@vsbuffalo Why on earth would you follow @StealthMountain? (no offense intended to Mr. sneak peak)
@graydon2 right. I'm taking precautions w/ logs etc. but so far it hasn't changed the results. #Rstats must have a very safe algo for means
I'm sure this will bite me later, but I'm actually surprised with how accurately #Rstats deals with very very tiny numbers #floatingpoint

@phdpqc I think @notmisha has a paper on the subject. iirc, they couldn't get it to work well but were optimistic. Cant get link now though.
@phdpqc my take from reading other smart people (mainly Scott Aaronson): it's quantum annealing, but not "quantum computer".

.@phdpqc Two stochastic, feed-forward methods that may replace undirected models for a while:
@phdpqc I don't know anyone but you that works with MLNs.
@phdpqc Very cool. Just to clarify, I was referring to other undirected models (i.e. RBMs and derivatives)
@phdpqc Perl (sort of).  Also lots of Perl-related projects.
@phdpqc a lot of folks I respect say undirected models are *great*, but have been frustrated with training algos &amp; switching to feedforward
@phdpqc don't know much. I don't know enough about logic to have much of an opinion about implementing it stochastically. Makes sense though

@phdpqc you could speed up bogosort by a decent (but constant) factor if you allowed *any* human sorted output as a termination condition.

@sarcozona hope it helps and you're feeling better than yesterday!
Sorting for Humans : Natural Sort Order. (BTW: Does #Rstats have a good function for this?)
@ucfagls @djhocking @recology_ @ethanwhite @hadleywickham yeah, I also use camelCase for functions and dots.as.separators for objects.
@ucfagls @ethanwhite @hadleywickham @djhocking my fingers hate typing underscores though :-(
@ogrisel @t3kcit @breuderink Right.  But I think the size of the hidden layer might need to be exponential in the size of the checkerboard.
@djhocking @hylopsar supposed to be compatible w/ packages built for 2.15.1 except for data.table and maybe few others. Haven't tried it.
@djhocking @phdpqc @hylopsar my question is if it also copies objects that aren't modified by the MCMC chain?
@phdpqc @hylopsar @djhocking Radford Neal is trying to limit copying in pqR:  (see updates at bottom for details).
@phdpqc @hylopsar @djhocking but in general, R makes lots of copies. Makes memory especially limiting when you're doing many jobs at once.
@phdpqc @hylopsar @djhocking maybe I'm wrong. And there are fancier options than what I've tried that probably don't make as many copies
@phdpqc @hylopsar @djhocking @rcourt yeah, but each thread gets a copy of everything. Easy to run out of mem w/ lots of cores.
@hylopsar I just had a chat about this with @djhocking and @phdpqc: get an SSD, lots of memory, &amp; trade cores for GHz depending on needs
@paix120 @bggas400 @viennateng @pandora_radio ditto
@hspter right. People get that wrong? Yikes.
@hspter hmm. Not sure what you mean. Maybe I'm guilty too?

@viennateng Thanks so much for picking my song for the 1000th-backer cover! Is there any way I could download a copy?
Hm, maybe I should have read that pseudocode a bit more carefully...
@sarcozona But the question of who pays for it (literally and figuratively) is really serious.

@sarcozona @szvan 1) help coming up with small goals (one or a few days' work)
@djhocking @phdpqc I'd say, only get the GPU if you already know how to use it. GPU programming is hard &amp; only helps on certain problems.
@phdpqc @TrevorABranch e.g. Americans say "an hour" or "a history" but Brits seem to use "an" for both.
@phdpqc @TrevorABranch The other exception (mainly in the UK?) is that some people don't treat "h" as a consonant, even if it's pronounced.
@TrevorABranch @phdpqc Agreed.
@djhocking This paper might be simpler:
@djhocking @phdpqc I'd err on the side of getting an SSD
@djhocking @phdpqc Maybe your tasks are small enough not to touch hdd, in which case it won't matter. But if not, an SSD makes a huge diff
@djhocking Huh.  Turns out they might not even need a new sampler for certain discrete distributions!
@djhocking sounds like you're right. They're planning on adding other samplers but for now it sounds like you're doing the right thing
@djhocking I think it can do likelihoods for discrete, but not sampling. So binomial GLMMs are ok, but finite mixtures aren't ready yet
@noamross My Rcpp code is pretty trivial at this point &amp; doesn't really do ecology or simulation.  Sorry!
@djhocking Intel processor with lots of cores. Lots of memory. SSD if your data sets are big.  Also, try stan--can be much faster than JAGS.

@hylopsar @Phalaropus I don't *actually* care about the tree details for my analysis (just need chickens to be closer to ducks than crows).
@hylopsar @Phalaropus You're probably right.  I'll find a way to make it work.

.@RosieRedfield @Graham_Coop @RELenski wait. A non-OA paper was reprinted w/o permission and you're blaming #OA?
@RELenski @RosieRedfield I believe one book failed to cite authors, which would make it infringement. CC license ceases to be relevant then
@RosieRedfield infringement can happen regardless of license.
.@RosieRedfield would be great if the CC folks or journals provided legal support for authors like fsf does for programmers. Maybe they do.
.@RosieRedfield I think the "silly" assumption is that outsourcing right to sue to Elsevier or Springer would protect authors' interests 1/2
@RosieRedfield it's not their copyright. It's yours. One benefit: publisher also can't threaten to sue your colleagues for classroom use
.@RosieRedfield copyright enforcement == legal threats by owner.  Unless you're willing to sue, must rely on norms, regardless of license.
.@RosieRedfield if they violate the license, they're infringing. So it's the same as if you hadn't licensed it at all 1/2
@phdpqc yeah. Salakhutdinov has more hacks for layer-by-layer initialization in later papers. Very confusing.
@phdpqc idea that learning ≈ learning better priors is appealing.  MCMC-based stochastic approx, combined with mean field is a huge pain.
@ucfagls package should probably let users mix and match: 1) choose functions for generating latent vars 2) choose distributions to sample
@ucfagls I'd be interested! I think ecology really needs better techniques for simulating this sort of thing.
@ucfagls what are your priorities at this point?
@ucfagls agreed.   Could be fun to use Gaussian processes to allow for arbitrary (smooth) response shapes. Can't balloon much from there!
@ucfagls I do think that a simple version would be ok: simulate a grid, give each species a linear or quadratic response, &amp; feed to rpois.
@ucfagls Ah, yes.  Sorry for confusion.  He mentioned vegan in another context.
@ucfagls Yes. He mentioned simulating environmental values &amp; then simulating presence/absence from that? Rudimentary, but maybe relevant.
@ucfagls Cool. I think tools already exist in `vegan` (mentioned in a talk later in my session), but maybe only for presence/absence.
@ucfagls cool. Enjoy your meeting.

Last tweet on the subject: Just saw a little girl wearing a TSA badge sticker. What does that say about our values?
I'm genuinely curious what TSA would have done if they *had* found a 9-Volt in my bag. They sure put a lot of effort into looking for one
@ucfagls also, how effective can they be at "the beat" when they're occupied checking for $1.75 tickets instead of, you know, crime?
Shh! Don't let TSA know that you can get 9 volts from a bunch of AA's:  #circuits101
@ucfagls are the UK officers carrying firearms, truncheons, pepper spray, and tasers?
Also relevant: the person in charge of these policies is about to become the president of UC
At least they don't know I own this watch: "the sign of Al Qaeda" &amp; rationale for kidnapping an torturing innocents
Also relevant: TSA can't tell the difference between two AAs and a 9-volt
Apparently TSA will pull aside and check any bag with a 9-volt battery because "they're used by terrorists a lot"
I've discovered something worse than TSA agents: TSA trainees.
Why does Minneapolis need *two fully-armed cops* to check my fare on the light rail?

This #ESA2013 talk is just: don't discretize continuous variables if possible. Good advice and well-presented, weird that we need it in 2013
Best #ESA2013 slide if all time? Risks and benefits of scaling models across scales: Image shows mouse w/ helmet by a mousetrap with cheese.
@srsupp you too! Enjoy the rest of the conference and your new gig in New York!
@djhocking @DanMcGlinn I wonder if this is consistent with the first few axes of ordination explaining a lot of variance. Different scales?
@srsupp food sounds like a great idea. Maybe I'll join you afterwards.

@ethanwhite @jessicablois no problem. See you around then. Good luck at your talk!
@ethanwhite @jessicablois I'd actually love to get your opinion on my stuff on Monday so I could incorporate it into my talk, if you're free
@jessicablois @ethanwhite darn. Want to meet and compare notes some time this week?
@st3powers for what it's worth:
@Graham_Coop good point. not everything has to be solved with copyright. @phdpqc @ethanwhite @janhjensen cf:
@ethanwhite @Graham_Coop @phdpqc @janhjensen @RosieRedfield BTW, I'll still license stuff cc-by; I just expect to be unhappy with some uses.
@ethanwhite @Graham_Coop @phdpqc @janhjensen Which is exactly what @RosieRedfield's original post was about!
@Graham_Coop @phdpqc @ethanwhite @janhjensen Not disagreeing. But authors' feelings of being cheated and associated with scams are legit too
@phdpqc @ethanwhite @janhjensen My sense is most scientists are more okay with text mining than repackaging/resale.
@Graham_Coop @ethanwhite @janhjensen Motivations for Wikipedia are different &amp; stakes are lower.
@ethanwhite @janhjensen yes. Also, authors are at least sorta okay with their publisher (by definition). But this opens it up to *everyone*.
@Graham_Coop @ethanwhite @janhjensen and most people wouldn't want their name associated with a "daft", "sleazy" "scam"....
@ethanwhite @janhjensen I see it as a cc-noncommercial issue. Scientists, I talk to are really weirded out by resale/repackaging.
@jessicablois will you be going to #ESA2013? You might enjoy my talk on co-occurrence in SDMs
@kcranstn @rmounce @ctitusbrown @BehavEcology @IanDworkin @kaythaney @ethanwhite who's "we?" Lots of folks that are terrible about it.
@janhjensen @RosieRedfield @brembs @ethanwhite @MikeTaylor maybe no legal diff, but the feelings are real. #OA advocates should address them
@janhjensen @RosieRedfield @brembs @ethanwhite @MikeTaylor being repackaging by a scammy publisher can pollute your image &amp; feels gross 2/2
@janhjensen you're not acknowledging  @RosieRedfield's point. Being used in lecture notes is nice... 1/2 @brembs @ethanwhite @MikeTaylor
@hylopsar @james_gilbert makes sense. Good call
@janhjensen @RosieRedfield @brembs @ethanwhite @MikeTaylor agreed, but I'd still *feel* slimy if my material was sold by a slimy publisher.
@james_gilbert another approach: fit separate models for each case you're currently using RJ for and using DIC for model comparison 3/3
@james_gilbert you probably need different proposal distributions for the different model dimensions. Could get tricky. 2/3
@james_gilbert could be an RJ issue. Best guess: Once it gets to a high likelihood state, almost all proposals from there get rejected. 1/2
@james_gilbert I don't think I've ever seen samples like that before. Could it be a bug of some kind? What model are you fitting?
@hspter @hadleywickham Worst case scenario: fit the regression separately and use `abline` to add the line from the fitted slope/intercept
@hspter @hadleywickham looks like it accepts any quantile function. Maybe not empirical though. Set `distribution = qnorm` to something else
@mmparker @hspter why?
@sarcozona :-(
.@wcwetzel @ElDon78 @Graham_Coop Absolutely. I'll be presenting "non-null" models of species assemblages at #ESA2013
@ElDon78 @wcwetzel @Graham_Coop basically looking for a name for approach that moves processes out of error term into model proper 2/2
@ElDon78 @wcwetzel @Graham_Coop null models are missing a process that may be important; another approach is to include &amp; estimate it 1/2

@phdpqc I may have said this before, but Salakhutdinov (and his students!) routinely publish some of the coolest stuff in the entire field.
@ethanwhite exactly. But I want to distinguish what I do from the null approach.
.@Graham_Coop I feel like "alternative" still implies that the default option is the null, which it isn't in my case.
Is there a word for models that *aren't* null?
@johnmyleswhite Looks like they're still *studied* at least.
@johnmyleswhite I had no idea Hopfield nets were still used.  I assumed they'd been displaced by Boltzmann machines.

PostgreSQL is amazing. Really excited to try out PostGIS.

@ethanwhite @recology_ @metamattj good point. Some really big science projects use it, but they're in a different league
@ethanwhite @recology_ @metamattj There's definitely something to that.
@ethanwhite @recology_ Make is less transparent when workflows are huge. Another alternative is Maven. 5/5
@ethanwhite @recology_: @metamattj admits Kepler can be tricky to learn too. 4/n
@ethanwhite @recology_ Kepler may also be better when the project is huge and needs input from non-experts 3/n
@ethanwhite @recology_ But make might not always be as flexible as, e.g., Python for automation. Kepler tries to be that flexible. 2/n
@ethanwhite @recology_: I asked @metamattj. Here's his answer (1/n): Make is good for keeping track of dependencies for software.
@ethanwhite Didn't realize that.  Cool.
@ethanwhite For parallel, it has a cool ad-hoc cluster tool that lets you use a bunch of laptops as a cluster.
@ethanwhite it has benefits of Make, plus easier learning curve. And some built-in functionality analogous to @rOpenSci or data retriever
.@recology_ @vsbuffalo On the plus side, Duncan Temple Lang seems to have contributed. If he thinks it's worthwhile, I'm sold--Java or no
Kepler has some really nice tools for distributed computing (hadoop, plumbing for SSH, nice tools for ad-hoc clusters) #nceasSI

.@vsbuffalo Have any insight/expectations about how R-Core will respond?
I never imagined anyone could use so many branches #git #Rstats #pqR
@tdhopper They'll expire when Twitter stops supporting them.
@noamross yikes!
I have a new introduction to maximum likelihood in #Rstats on @noamross's blog.
@revodavid @noamross Thanks!
@se_hampton @ErikaMudrak @nceas @mpsaloha it's pretty common to type something, get an error about permissions, add sudo, and have it work.
@se_hampton @ErikaMudrak @nceas @mpsaloha sudo is "DO as Super User". Using it gives you more privileges to tell the computer what to do.
@noamross thanks for formatting my thingy, btw. Good to know about 'spin'
@jebyrnes thanks!
I/O on this 40-gigabyte file is making me wish I had gotten an SSD
@srsupp only context I run into it is setting a value inside of 'system.time'.   Eg system.time(myvar= result.of.long.computation)
@phylorich @srsupp I don't think @rstudioapp auto-converts to &lt;-
@srsupp I know r-forge has been doing maintenance.  It may be done now though.
@srsupp I use = because it's much easier to type.  The cases where it behaves differently from &lt;- are rare and easy to anticipate.
@sarcozona this fits one of your hobby-horses, I believe...
@noamross we have one?
Woke up so many times last night that I had a dream about reading a book about how to sleep through the night.
@vsbuffalo you learned pop gen existed last month?
@noamross I always assumed it meant they had a terrible website.
@jbkinney @JFWSchlesinger I'll try to double-check after I arrive tonight.
@jbkinney @JFWSchlesinger I believe Michael Jordan makes the claim in this video around the 15-minute mark.
@sciencegurlz0 @hylopsar WAT.   Seriously, what's that paper even about?
@JFWSchlesinger I'm traveling now, but I'll try to find the reference or you.
@jbkinney @JFWSchlesinger Bayes isn't an extension of frequentism: If you condition on the data, you often *can't* condition on the model.
@noamross @recology_ Looks like the help files are buried in a binary. Probably no easy way to intercept them manually.
@phylorich Ooh, I had forgotten about sub.  I would have done something silly with gsub instead. @hylopsar
@jbkinney arguably, the contributions are more indirect (method development and testing), but they're still valuable. We need good methods.
@jbkinney more seriously, there are some very smart frequentists that contribute a lot to science. Efron is one. 1/2
@jbkinney Bayes only tells us what we want to know correctly some % of the time. Freq analysis lets us know what the % is.
@jbkinney what *I* want to know?
model) is important when the "true" model lies outside the hypothesis space (essentially always).
@jbkinney @leonidkruglyak More to frequentism than p values.  Bias/variance decomp., PAC bounds, etc. all require fixed model &amp; random data
@jbkinney frequentism is about guarantees that methods/procedures will actually work. It's an important complement to hypothesis exploration
@jbkinney including the Venn diagram? Seriously?
Is there *any* alternative to @comcast in West #DavisCA these days?
@phdpqc very highly recommended.
Maybe it's time to write a spec.
This week's Weird Science is great, per usual
@leonidkruglyak @mbeisen @jbkinney @MichelleNMeyer right. Is there any reason to think the BRCA genes are reverse-transcribed?
@ethanwhite @bendmorris @squirrelbert Got it, thanks.  Much appreciated!
@ethanwhite @bendmorris The download links both say " not found on this server." :-(
@ethanwhite @bendmorris thanks! I'll check when I get to the office later today.
@ethanwhite @bendmorris @weecology okay, thanks anyway. Congrats on the paper :-)
@ethanwhite @bendmorris @weecology BTW, do they release lat/long for individual stops, or just routes? Want to look at spatial autocorr...
@bendmorris @ethanwhite @weecology also, want to find a Latin name? Look in the "Spanish common name" column.
.@ethanwhite @weecology @bendmorris the first time I tried it, it took *much* more than one day.
One day to import the BBS data by hand? You guys are funny. @weecology @bendmorris @ethanwhite
@phylorich @PhilippBayer more discussion here
I also found directions like "JUST BEFORE RISE AND FARM ON RIGHT", but that doesn't help me.
Does anyone know where I can find the coordinates of individual stops along Breeding Bird Survey routes? I can just find route-level coords.
@julia_saltz makes sense. Thanks.
@hspter @vsbuffalo @mbeisen Makes sense. What about cDNA from individual exons? No new sequences there...
How important is cDNA for molecular work? Could researchers make do with mRNA for most tasks? cc @vsbuffalo @mbeisen
@vsbuffalo are there any naturally-occurring retroviruses that reverse-transcribe the BRCA genes? Serious question.
@mbeisen I guess they're saying the intron-free sequence doesn't exist *as DNA* in nature.
@leonidkruglyak @ewanbirney @DrWorms Smuckers sued a pie maker for infringing on something like this. Pie maker had a century of prior art.
@phdpqc thanks!

@sarcozona blarg. Sorry. Glad you were up to talking last night, at least--had a great time.   Feel better soon!
@phdpqc @ethanwhite Thanks!
@sarcozona #nakedworkday?
Does anyone have examples of cover letters they wrote to journals? I'm not sure how to proceed.  Something modeling-related would be ideal.
Rereading @DynamicEcology's advice about cover letters as I get ready to submit!
I think I broke the @PNASNews article submission form...
I donated to @EFF to put an end to unchecked government surveillance.
Bayes if you have a real prior; Empirical Bayes if you can estimate a prior from the data; otherwise be careful! 6/6
I wish Efron had made Empirical Bayes clearer, but I think his advice in the last paragraph is spot on: 5/6
The drug trial example makes the distinction between estimating an effect and designing a procedure really clear. 4/n
Disagree frequentists are more objective: model choice &amp; regularization can play almost identical roles to the prior for Bayesians 3/n
Bayes is good at combining data from different sources (e.g. "prior" information). Freq. optimizes a loss function over repeated trials. 2/n
I really like Brad Efron's perspective on Bayes (paywalled:  1/n
This sunburn makes me feel like a real ecologist!
@The_Evan @0xabad1dea @realnudel how exactly could Congress even have objected?
@tomscott @hspter the law is clear on this issue: burritos are not sandwiches.
@johnmyleswhite one review that comes to mid would fail that test, but it could have identified my old lab.
@joshrossi @0xabad1dea then he should stop pretending we're making the decisions together.
@0xabad1dea I love how he says we have to make choices "as a society," but he wouldn't tell society what he was doing.
@sarcozona hey, still feeling decent?
Can one infer prevalence from presence-only data? Nope (part 2):
I cannot believe how much time it takes to format everything for journals if you're not a LaTeX wizard.
@qx I know that @noamross has been really impressed with the data.table package.  More suggestions here:  @phylorich
Wow, suddenly my manuscript is looking *really really good*.  Can't wait to get rid of it and start working on analyses for the next one.
Can one infer prevalence from presence-only data? Not even a little bit.
@cboettig @jbkinney thanks
@DrHanneke @sarcozona a reviewer said that??
Cool paper on learning a structured kernel function for Gaussian process regression:  cc @cboettig @_NickGolding_
@jbkinney yep: Same model used for phylogenetic comparisons. Just not sure if/how it relates to the regression models @cboettig uses
Is there a relationship between Brownian models of trait evolution and Gaussian processes? Are they the same thing? cc @cboettig
I'm really excited about this machine learning paper by @notmisha:
@sarcozona score!
On a related note, I have an awesome dissertation committee and very helpful friends. Thanks everyone!
I'm blown away by how much my manuscript has improved in the past week. Why couldn't I have just written it like this the first time?
@_NickGolding_ good to know. Thanks.
@ZachWeiner also a good point.
@ZachWeiner fair enough. There would be technical problems with the scheme too, if DNA sequences had errors.
@ZachWeiner would you oppose a system that only provided a one-way hash of the DNA? Could compare with a database without reading contents.
@ZachWeiner I haven't followed the case, but how is DNA constitutionally different from fingerprinting?
@_NickGolding_ turns out Cholesky decompositions can be faster on sparse (mostly zero) matrices. Might be useful for GRaF in some contexts.
FYI, I have a birthday coming up...
@matingmind @edyong209 not sure why that should be "obvious" to anyone, but okay.
@Graham_Coop @noahWG does that imply that citation count is a good proxy for the other stuff too?
@srsupp yeah, thanks! Always good to keep the end point in mind. Plan was to submit tomorrow. Let's see if I make it.
I cannot believe how sick I am of this manuscript.
@sarcozona hope they help!
"Clean" music versions are so weird.  "I'd have killed him" is fine, but the next word has four letters, so it gets bleeped.
@sarcozona Let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
apparently @JSTOR blocks access to *citation* information for @zotero if you're not on campus? Not cool.
@sarcozona Stop it!
Questions like "Am I considered an 'employee' for purposes of X?" should not take ten emails to resolve.
@vsbuffalo I read that as "C# coding music".

@JeremyJBerg @johnmyleswhite thanks!
@vsbuffalo felt it here too.
I’m looking for a good intro to linear models for an undergrad with essentially no stats background. Any suggestions, hive mind?
@edyong209 what about the golden palace dot com monkey?

@surlyhobbit @Popehat they're still using Cooper's name?!
@noamross thanks! I wouldn't even know what to do with 88 cores. Want to chat about it at D-RUG? Thanks again!
@noamross my AWS-fu is weak, but I might want to run one last analysis. Having the option to do it quickly would be really great.
@noamross Not sure if I'll need it yet, but could you maybe run an R job for me on EC2 in exchange for reimbursement &amp; drinks?
@jebyrnes I've always used imageJ for that sort of thing, but I'm not sure how script able it is. Good luck!
@noamross By "voting" do you mean "click the follow button?"

@abby_ebooks, are you sure you're just spouting bigrams?

@jessicablois wait, what?
@hspter congrats!
@duffy_ma @SciTriGrrl @labroides if it disappears, you could always get one of these...
@DailyCaller @Popehat I don't see a link to the Media Matters post you're quoting.
Odd. Bengio says (p 12) that annealing hasn't helped training efficiency, but the papers he cites in the previous sentence disagree....

@noamross FYI, just noticed that RStan combines samples across multiple MCMC chains by default.
stan has the best warnings: "non-fatal (really) issue (and please ignore that what comes next might say 'error')"
@0xabad1dea Oh wow.  I wouldn't have expected a bigram model to work so well. Maybe the shortness of tweets helps.  Very cool.
@0xabad1dea Thanks!
@0xabad1dea Did you write her algorithm yourself? Is there a blog post describing her process?

@hspter it’s not even the whole gene, right? More like a bunch of SNP’s? (Not a geneticist)
@dschoolmaster @hadleywickham @michaelhoffman not saying mixture is ideal, but it might not be worse than common alternatives.
@dschoolmaster @hadleywickham @michaelhoffman another example: some interpretations of PCA imply data is generated by a multivar normal
@dschoolmaster @hadleywickham @michaelhoffman valid point, but people report mean and sd when the process isn't normal...
@JSTORSupport thanks!
@JSTOR who should I email about broken typesetting in an article I wrote? See the equations in this section:

Hopefully, those will be able to save someone an hour of googling. The 2nd tip came from page 8 of this document:
2) If you want #LaTeX in your table, use "sanitize.text.function = function(x){x}" in the print function.
1) When printing an xtable object, use the "comment = FALSE" option, so that you don't have to see a comment about when the table was made.

That's 187,000,000-to-one odds.  Perhaps it's a bit overconfident there.
There's a spot in Alaska where my model says the probability of observing an American Robin during the breeding season is about 0.9999999947
@hspter I think so. I don't really understand this newfangled emoji stuff either
@hspter 😿
Mix, my Markov chains! Mix!
@PeterFlomStat @tdoyon R will warn if you dial down the tolerance in glm.control to 1e-14 and raise maxit. Still not good.
@Rbloggers Better yet, the `bayesglm` function in `arm` keeps both the expectations and standard errors reasonable. 2/2
@Rbloggers @christoper_hamm R will warn if glm.control has lower tolerance (epsilon = 1e-14) and higher iteration count (maxit = 50).  1/2
I really like how #ggplot2 lets you store figures as #rstats objects.  Is there a way to do the same with base graphics?

I'm slowly learning--if it mentions Markov chains, you can probably delete it or move it to the Appendix.
@_NickGolding_ @phylorich adding to rasters works well on some graphics devices but not others. It's possible that was your problem.
Making complicated figures in #Rstats always feels so goofy. I never know what to expect when I change the size of the plotting canvas.
