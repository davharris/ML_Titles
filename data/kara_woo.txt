New favorite twitter account: @HarrisBot.
@HarrisBot Yes.
@gvwilson I've been looking for some more vegetarian inspiration, this looks great! Any recipes in particular you'd recommend from it?
So health insurance. Very benefits. Wow.
@gvwilson Brilliant.
@BabyWasu Even still I'm impressed you were able to avoid it for that long.
@BabyWasu ummm what have you been doing with your life?
@DrInsectivore YAY!!!

@_inundata It's not uncommon that I google something &amp; find a blog post by you or other smart friends about exactly what I was looking for.
Just had a (very rare) moment of going back to some old code and thinking "hey, this is actually pretty nice!"
@amyrbrown That is...wow. Then he goes on to say they should learn from Youtube videos ON THEIR PHONES??
@DistribEcology Looks snazzy!

@phylogenomics Confused why I need to sign up for an account in order to read this. :-/
@EvoEcoAmy Sure! I'm not an expert on all its features by a long shot, but happy to help if I can.
@EvoEcoAmy Ah, can't speak to that in particular. Group projects in Mendeley are $$$, that was a big motivator for choosing Zotero.
@EvoEcoAmy I've been happy with Zotero.
@cgranade aarrrgghh &gt;.&lt;
@cgranade @drskyskull @AstroKatie IME "no dress code" can mean quite different things for women, POC as opposed to white guys however.
Today's peeve: @pandora_radio and @Spotify both seem to think that when I say I want "blues" that means "no women artists, please".
@Gastove How does one win this game, I wonder?
.@algaebarnacle I especially like the call for faculty to not forget to be in solidarity with workers outside the university.
University of Illinois-Chicago faculty explain current strike.  via @jacobinmag
@cgranade Yeah, it is definitely insufficiently nuanced (to put it EXTREMELY nicely).
@cgranade If we're thinking of the same one, I couldn't even bring myself to finish. So heterosexist, and only two gender categories. SMH.
@hspter but...I already know why they are all horrible.

Welcome to twitter, @willnotburn.
@Dr24hours This has been happening to me on the web version of tweetdeck too and it is annoying.
@_inundata @hspter corroborated
.@labmgr93 "You're so vain, you probably think this subtweet is about you."
My bus buddy and I got so engrossed in talking about Baikal plankton that we almost missed our stop.
@cbahlai ...Now trying to picture what a risqué data management topic would be. I can't think of anything. Probably better that way.
@cbahlai One of these days I might take you up on this.
@DrJaneChi That...makes the utmost sense. I will do that next time. Thanks :)
@DrJaneChi If my doc isn't up to date on these recs do you have advice for bringing it up? I don't want to tell them how to do their job.
@cmyeaton it’s been a while since I grew my hair out from really short but I’m thinking I’ll just get trims to avoid the dreaded mullet.
@hspter I was thinking that earlier and meant to comment! @cmyeaton I'm growing mine out too, we can go through the awkward stages together.
@cmyeaton Good point. Better just play with toy dollhouse workout equipment instead.
@kwbroman I'm really enjoying picturing what a very dramatic cat food spill looks like.
@noahtron Which is probably what they were going for, except they failed hard by throwing in that condescending line.
@noahtron Right, the way to go would've been to advertise it as a women's fitness class in a supportive and welcoming environment.
@noahtron Yeah. A women's weightlifting class *could* be a great idea. If it weren't for that sentence I might have even signed up.
@noahtron B) Those who don't aren't necessarily frightened, just inexperienced. 2/2
@noahtron It's the assumption that all women are overwhelmed at the sight of exercise equipment. A) plenty of women know how to use it. 1/2
@labroides I actually would like to learn to work out more effectively, but not from people who think I'll faint at the sight of a barbell.
Hey ladiez, does walking past gym equipment give you the vapors? Well we've got the solution for you!
@amyrbrown No worries! Thanks for the reply. :)
I'm kind of transfixed by this alphabet primer that began the Olympic ceremonies in Russia (with shoutout to Baikal).
@kwbroman Now that I've said that I really hope the dude can afford a coat and is just choosing not to wear one.
@kwbroman There's a guy who regularly rides my bus in a tshirt and jeans even in single digit weather. I think it's some kind of statement?

@amyrbrown P.S. I saw these tweets when I clicked over to twitter away from the email I was writing...to you. :)
@amyrbrown High schoolers *can* be pretty awesome sometimes.
@amyrbrown Huh, that's a pretty good point actually.
@amyrbrown Now I'm really curious.
@noahtron Exactly! What's the cutoff between "cold" and "bitterly cold"?
@noahtron It's definitely cold. I'm just wondering since when does  write such poetic descriptions of the weather?
says it's not just cold, it's "bitterly cold".
@DrJaneChi *shudders*
@tpoi yaay congratulations!
@algaebarnacle waah so cute!
@noahtron &gt;.&lt;
@queerscientist yikes! :( and yeah we have snow. I’m actually loving being back in cold weather, but no one seems to believe me.
@queerscientist The move went well, thanks, and Pullman is pretty good so far.

Really moving montage of Philip Seymour Hoffman scenes. Still in disbelief.  HT @BenSaunders
@carlystrasser Will be interesting to see how it plays out. Going to the library every time you hit a paywall seems inefficient &amp; unlikely.
"We are not obliged to provide equal time and space to unscientific and dangerous viewpoints" re anti-vax coverage.
@Gastove I prefer the theory that they are one big clonal network of owls (à la Pando), connected by invisible fibers. #SuperbOwl
Hoffman is national news before we're sure the family has been notified. That is inexcusable.
So saddened to hear about Philip Seymour Hoffman. He was an actor of truly exceptional talent, one of the very best in my opinion.

@artologica Just took my painting to the store to get a frame. Cashier was oohing and ahing over it so I gave her a link to your shop. :)
@leeflower @feminazgul Agreed, cream cheese (or cream cheese frosting) can belong in/on cookies with complementary flavors.
@leeflower @feminazgul Oh certainly. But real peanut butter on real cookies. None of the masquerading.
@leeflower @feminazgul I do not support any step of this weird food transformation chain. Leave peanut butter and cookies alone.
@leeflower To come full circle we now need cream cheese flavored cookies.
@leeflower Well TJ's does sell "cookie butter". Maybe after that no one wanted regular peanut butter so they put it in cream cheese instead?
@leeflower EXACTLY. Also peanut butter flavored cream cheese sounds gross.
@leeflower ....but...why on earth....
@metroadlib He's going to be in a *celebrity* boxing match.
@noahtron @duffy_ma Glad to hear it!
@ejwillingham (Part of that is my racial privilege, but that still doesn't explain all these articles like the one you tweeted. )
@ejwillingham I'm baffled too. I've had many long and short hairstyles and no one has ever seemed to care about them either way.
@recology_ I've looked up property management companies on Yelp, but reviews are probably biased toward disgruntled tenants.

@ejwillingham Do you have any refs off the top of your head?
@ejwillingham Yeah, it had never actually occurred to me that vax would also temper severity of the flu if one does catch it.
@ejwillingham This is so sad. And on top of it I happen to be in a Facebook comment debate about flu vaccines right this moment.
@speakup4sci @cbahlai Ha! The pic's a little old, I've now started the long awkward process of growing my hair out. A hat'd be extra good.
@LKluber If I'd had one of those I'd have saved myself hours of work!
Today is one of those days when I feel like a data detective. Someone get me a cool hat and magnifying glass. #otherpeoplesdata
"Ultimately, measures that reduce conflict among parties early on in the data sharing process will promote PDA."
@LKluber @artologica It was a wimpy snow this time. Reminds me I still need to get snow tires though (ugh).
This is great, but also the acronym "PDA" gives sentences amusing new meanings when taken out of context.
@LKluber @artologica The ink looks really cool up close. I love it! Need to brave the snowy streets &amp; pick up a frame so I can hang it ASAP.
@LKluber @artologica I got "Sea Creature 1", similar to this one:
Suggestions for facilitating public data archiving.  via @PLOSBiology
Thank you @artologica for the beautiful painting! It arrived today and looks amazing.
@noahtron I have a "glowy post rock" playlist for this. Lots of Sigur Rós in there (if I can't understand the lyrics they don't count).
@noahtron Not always, but sometimes. Depends on the work, but any music with lyrics tends to distract me more.
This music makes data management seem very dramatic.
Also more coffee.
Today = coffee, pancakes, a view of snowy Pullman from my living room window, ballet music on the stereo, and some serious data wrangling.
@amaditalks And in another tweet she links to Dan Savage to make her point? Of course she does.
@_inundata This is that kind of scary satire that is probably actually also true.
@SciTriGrrl @drugmonkeyblog If I figure it out twitter will be the first to know.
@drugmonkeyblog @SciTriGrrl If I were a grad student I'd be a little scared right now. It's a bit "abandon all hope, ye who enter here".
@algaebarnacle I'm so curious!
Found in my new desk.
@alexhanna Same here, and immediately after I tweeted that article I saw one come up in my feed and choked on my coffee.
RIP Pete Seeger.
@djhocking Bet it'd make a good anvil too if you spot Road Runner under your window.
@djhocking You weren't using all that desk space anyway, were you?
@recology_ @PLOS I too am curious about this.
@noahtron sigur ros is good for a lot of things really.
@hspter Waah, I wish I were still within driving distance. :(
@vruba I like the exuberant new avi.
@millerdl Oh my. The asterisk makes it even creepier.
@alexhanna I've been really happy with my simple Panasonic one.

@kTraphagen Are you looking for people who are living there right now? I don't anymore but did for a time.
@CackleofRad Now it all makes sense.
@kejames *eyeroll* seriously. It just sounds like some backwards attempt to gain moral high ground by appealing to...colonial history? #odd
@kejames "Chalk my execrable behavior up to cultural differences"? "Those Americans need to learn to be polite like us Brits"? So confused.
@kejames Yes, what WAS that??
@sennoma Was JUST thinking this about him and those defending him with this excuse.
If you repeatedly do sexist things and people then accuse you of being sexist, that is called "drawing conclusions based on evidence".
Listen, you do not get to say you're not sexist and have it be so, and then be soo hurt when others disagree. It doesn't work like that.
@BenBondLamberty @recology_ Which are cancelled out by several paragraphs of "but she was mean to me so really I was justified".
A double whammy of nonpologies from Nature and Henry Gee...can I go back to bed now?

I never expected the blog would lead to chances for me to act as a mentor in some small way, but this is really cool. My day has been made.
It's great to know people out there are reading the blog and getting interested in our work.
I just got a really nice email from an undergrad who reads the Baikal blog and wants to talk about combining science, #scicomm, and Russian!
@_inundata "You must return here with a shrubbery or else your package will never make it onto CRAN...alive."
@BioDataGanache I always thought the latter but now I’m not sure.
@kwbroman Getting there, yeah. I'm enjoying it so far.
@kwbroman Yup, noted. On an unrelated note, have you got any trips to Pullman in the works yet?
@kwbroman "Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you don't reply to emails." -- brilliant, I'm going to use this quotation.
The response from @drisis, however, is excellent.
At first I honestly thought @HenryGeeBooks was a parody account. This unprofessionalism is reprehensible, esp. for someone in his position.
@artologica И жизнь, как посмотришь с холодным вниманьем вокруг — такая пустая и глупая шутка...
@artologica I would favorite this but that somehow now seems like a hyper-American move.
It's so true though. I can't tell you how many Russians have told me they think Americans are insincere because we always say we're "fine".
"If you lack the Russian vocabulary to fully express your unquenchable suffering, fear not — a lot...can be packed into just a word or two."
Amusing breakdown on the greatest of Russian-American cultural divides: the response to the question "How are you?"

@cbahlai  P.S. did you ever read this post by @cmyeaton  Very relevant to #otherpeoplesdata.
@cbahlai At least we can be grateful that the data aren't in PDFs?
@lavika There are lots of data repositories at this point. Bigger challenge is incentivizing/requiring/enforcing data sharing.

@zentree @ucfagls @cbahlai Right, but I've seen data from professional scientists who didn't.
@polesasunder @recology_ These look SO GOOD.
.@ucfagls @zentree @cbahlai ...but what about when people start color coding cells to indicate different treatments? 2/2
.@ucfagls @zentree @cbahlai Excel just makes it all too easy to manage data in ghastly ways. That picture may not be *too* horrible... 1/2
@ucfagls @zentree @cbahlai I'm confused too...
We get it, Santa Barbara, your sunsets are very pretty, now quit showing off.
Storify of #otherpeoplesdata, now featuring a tweet by yours truly.  HT @NEONInc
@cbahlai -____-
@cbahlai uh oh....
@CackleofRad congrats!
Minus my trip home for the holidays I only have a week left in SB before the move. Freakout commencing. Please send calming doge pics.
@polesasunder yeah, we used #baikal13.
@polesasunder I like both. 1st is more characters but more informative. 2nd is good  if you'll be tweeting about non-work stuff too.
@polesasunder There might be a way to get it to return a link to the tweet, I can't remember. That'd make it easier storify later.
@polesasunder I sometimes tweeted with the twitteR #rstats package which saved having to load a browser window every time I wanted to tweet.
@polesasunder Or you could add them to a storify draft as you go. Do you know what your internet situation will be in Borneo?
@polesasunder No, they're there forever unless you delete them, you might just have to scroll back a ways to find them.
@polesasunder Not too much; we used one (but didn't storify). Just remember searching hashtags after a couple weeks doesn't really work.
@polesasunder You definitely should!
@polesasunder @asriborneo Whoa, awesome!
@cmyeaton You can do it!
(must give credit to @mpsaloha for that bit of Excel humor)
"Excel is not your lab notebook": practical advice from @cbahlai on exercising your 2nd amendment right to use Excel.
I said I went to SF to visit friends but really I did it to get an @rOpenSci sticker.
@rmounce congrats!
@srsupp @cbahlai +1
@cbahlai awesome!
@KirkwoodLab it was Forbidden Planet.
@BioDataGanache yes thank you!
Can anyone tell me what this movie is?
@IanMulvany Hello!
@AnsonMackay hahaha!
@srsupp @cbahlai @thelabandfield @nushiamme Yikes.
@studentactivism "If you're not paying for something, you're not the customer; you're the product..." We're just a sentient product.
@davidjayharris I've seen people create multiple accounts to continue harassing. But same could've happened with the new functionality.
@recology_ @winston_chang @hadleywickham I think there's a Chrome extension that lets you see them.
Twitter really ought to think about which users are most targeted for abuse and therefore likely to be forced out due to new block policy.
@SarahNMoon The support page says if you have a protected account, blocking does force them to unfollow.
@kejames Great point. I also think drawing attention to double standards as a strategy for selling beauty products is a BIT disingenuous.
@_inundata God probably set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolved to contain the disk with the data god wants.
@MGhydro Mine too.
@MGhydro Last year's was even more thorough I think.
The 2013 Hater's Guide to the Williams-Sonoma Catalog is here.  "OH BUT THIS WAFFLE MAKER GOES TO ELEVEN, YOU SEE."
@hylopsar I will do no such thing.
@DrJaneChi @ChiefElk NO NO NO
@cbahlai Yes, let the memory slowly fade away like a bad dream...
@cbahlai Oh joy.
@mdegs @drdrewsteen I haven't upgraded in the hope that Tweetbot will eventually realize they're being jerks.
@cbahlai If you reshape so species are separate columns it'll put NAs where species weren't seen. Then convert NAs to 0s and reshape back.
@cbahlai This is familiar. @se_hampton fixed a similar issue in our data with some clever `reshape`-fu.
@amv_fournier @cbahlai @labroides Hope it helps!
@ethanwhite @cbahlai @NEONInc @elitabaldridge I'd be up for helping as well.
@amv_fournier @labroides @cbahlai and  [pdf]
@amv_fournier @labroides @cbahlai This was my first intro:  Also see:
@labroides @cbahlai It's so great that you train students in this stuff. Just try not to put me out of a job please. ;-)
@labroides @cbahlai I didn't have formal training as a student and look at me now. The basics aren't hard, but need some incentive to learn.
@Gastove @cbahlai That is...wow.
@labroides @cbahlai I wonder if this person knew they were entering data or if they thought they were creating a word search puzzle.
@NEONInc @cbahlai Can I submit this tweet for inclusion?
@cbahlai Oh my god. OH MY GOD.
@cbahlai Can I ask if there's a particular reason you're doing each year separately? Is each year organized really differently or...?
@drdrewsteen I'm a fan of Tweetbot (but miffed that they force you to pay again to update to new version).
@davidjayharris New email from Brian Ripley. #FiveWordTechHorrors ;)
@cmyeaton Nice!
@kwbroman At least we're not alone in this misery. (And I promise I'll stop tweeting that video now.)
@kwbroman No keep it, I need to recondition myself.
@kwbroman I jumped out of my chair to stand in croisée derrière with my right arm in second. Dangerous while driving.
@kwbroman And—not making this up—once home I googled Pavlovian responses to music and one of the hits had an auto-play ad with GUESS WHAT.
@kwbroman I've had quite enough Nutcracker flashbacks today. Two radio commercials used Trepak music on my drive home.
@kwbroman Ugh Karl did you choose that avatar just to mess with me?
Here's the data in PDF. #FiveWordTechHorrors @cmyeaton
@AnsonMackay Guess it's time to create a new column in my Tweetdeck for #Baikal14. :)
Ah yes, Nutcracker flashback season, when every other commercial uses the music I danced to for years with @kwbroman.
@FrostNoodle Yup. Boss got a new job at Washington State so I'm moving with her.
Totally joining this @Meetup group when I get to Pullman.
It's quite a compliment to be put in a category with @ethanwhite. :D (realizing that tweet was worded ambiguously) @polesasunder @gvwilson
@djhocking Exactly what I needed, thanks so much.
@alexhanna SO EXCITED!
I've realized I've stopped following my RSS feeds because I hated both Feedly and The Old Reader. Hive mind suggestions?
Thanks @polesasunder for catalyzing a great chat in which @gvwilson flattered me majorly with the phrase "people like @ethanwhite and Kara".
@polesasunder @ethanwhite my meeting window is gone and yet I can still hear you. Now 100% convinced you’re ghosts.
@swcarpentry @polesasunder @ethanwhite I think we're already on it.
@polesasunder Those are some nice shelves. :)
@polesasunder @gvwilson I'm still around and free to chat. Or we could wait until @ethanwhite gets back.
@polesasunder Are we getting back online @gvwilson? @ethanwhite
@polesasunder Talk on here! I want to lurk. :) @gvwilson @ethanwhite
@avidbiologist Definitely not doing it. I was almost tempted by them offering to "let" me join the Alumni of Color Initiative, but still no.
But this whole "special invitation" stuff...please.
I like my university, Ray Kelly and failure to divest from coal notwithstanding. And I get that alumni donations pay for important programs.
They're even so kind as to offer me a choice between two exciting initiatives to volunteer for!
My alma mater is trying to recruit me in a pyramid scheme except not even pretending that profits will go anywhere except their own coffers.
I get that making things seem exclusive is a way to make people want them. But it needs to be a LITTLE less transparent in order to work.
I'd also be volunteering to recruit 30 more members to this "select group" in my 1st year and spamming them with Annual Fund emails.
Today my undergrad institution wrote to offer me a "special invitation" to join a "select group" of volunteers to solicit money from alumni.
@Gastove ...thanks a lot.
.@Feminist_Times says feminists should not wear heels, but then how will we crush all that menswear??  #feministheels
@Gastove I hear the Assorted Food is amazing.
@algaebarnacle I wrote a heated response to the editors. It's total nonsense, made worse by the horrible DV comparison.
Have any trans* feminists written about #feministheels and gender performance yet?
@iamdavidbrown That second one is perfect.
Utter garbage pretending to be feminism. Trigger warning for DV and inexcusable victim blaming.
@iamdavidbrown Anyway, I love that she's come back with "Saturday". It's very
@iamdavidbrown For sure. And teenage girls are an easy target. Patrice Wilson didn't get the same scorn despite actually writing the song.
@nickwan Though I think it's less of a self-diss and more of a playful shout-out to her haters.
Always a favorite: Grace Hopper on Letterman.
@nickwan Whatever it is, it's awesome. I love her.
@iamdavidbrown I do too. I never understood all the vitriol tbh. She's just a teenager who wants to have fun! People are mean.
Rebecca Black has a new song called...wait for it..."Saturday".
I made gingersnaps.
@queerscientist I like the cold and scoff inwardly at the people whining about 55. Someone literally said "it's too cold to function".
@_inundata Currently 6 degrees in Pullman. I need to hang out in some industrial freezers or something to prep for the move.
No one in Santa Barbara can believe how cold it is (it’s 55 degrees).
@infotroph Feel better, and in the meantime: awwwwwww.
Peanuts cartoons with lyrics from The Smiths. I think this one is my favorite:
@alexhanna @RuPaulsDragRace YESS
@hspter you've had good luck with rent the runway before right? I'm thinking of renting a dress for next weekend, would you recommend it?
@carlystrasser @swcarpentry looks like "wtf github" in the top left.
@cbahlai Oh my gosh, you poor thing. :(
@cbahlai What's that Sartre quotation? "Hell is other people's data"?
@kwbroman A minor hiccup. You are still cool and modern, don't worry.
It's hard to see @kwbroman's slides on the streaming video but luckily they're also already online.
Currently watching @kwbroman speak about "Using Microsoft Excel to obscure your data and annoy your readers".
The latest piece of @accidental__aRt reminds me of a lobster.
@kara_woo (aside from the really unfortunate hashtag)
"Women: buying our beauty products will help you combat sexist double standards." What's wrong with this picture?
@MachaNikolski @ctitusbrown @kaythaney @jsteeleeditor But there is something wrong with telling women their worth is tied to beauty.
@ctitusbrown @kaythaney @jsteeleeditor Yes, but different situation. Pantene used feminism as branding to make $ off sexist beauty industry.
.@kaythaney @jsteeleeditor @ctitusbrown A bit disingenuous IMO. "Women: buy our beauty products to combat gendered double standards."
@labroides yayy!!!
@recology_ @sjGoring @jhollist @andyteuche Yeah those are annoying. wasn't sure if they mattered for you or not.
@recology_ @sjGoring @jhollist @andyteucher Maybe like this:
@cgranade Thanks for the offer though! I may ping you with questions somewhere down the line.
@cgranade I am loving it so far too! I've been taking this class ( but now I'm just really behind.
Now I'm so behind that I can't face catching up. :(
I was doing great with this Python class until apartment hunting and holidays messed with my schedule.
.@nceas is all decked out (complete with fireplace on the tv) for @se_hampton’s farewell party.
@AstroKatie @_ColinS_ @BenLillie Yes, happy birthday!
@AstroKatie @_ColinS_ Yeah, what thing is that and where can I get one?
@_inundata  library(maps) california &lt;- map('county', 'california', plot = FALSE) california$names
@IKAworldwide Your intention and 50 cents will buy you a cup of coffee. It's sexist (not to mention it doesn't make sense). @kejames
I will never get tired of doge.
@vruba      wow              such lines                       many connect          very inform                                         wow
@polesasunder @QuantEcologyABC Misleading plots are evil. Tell her twitter disapproves. #convincing
@polesasunder @QuantEcologyABC Ooh that's bad. What's the point of pretty if they don't show the data properly?? I'm feeling your pain now.
@QuantEcologyABC @polesasunder Did she give any reason why she doesn't want to change it?
@_inundata Nope but I will be in town the 13th-15th.
Hilarious. @aamer_rahman describes real reverse racism.
@duffy_ma YAY! Congratulations!
"Every bilingual can be a translators." Maybe you should start by hiring some to write your ad copy?
@labmgr93 Unrelatedly, I saw your note about pronoun preference on your blog. Do you prefer the singular "they" or invented pronouns?
@labmgr93 What's your preferred way to keep all that organized? I have some ideas but I'd love to hear from more experienced people.
Tweeps who manage a lab: what do you wish you'd thought of at the beginning when setting up systems for organizing data, documents, etc.?
@Gastove Good luck!
Icelandic police have shot and killed someone for the first time in possibly forever.
@recology_ @sjGoring Ooh, never tried that before. I'll look into it, thanks.
@sjGoring Yeah, the automatic tweets are no good. Afraid I don't have much advice, I just try to remember to edit them before posting.
Feminism as represented by stock photos.  I guess feminists don't laugh alone with salad.
@recology_ @sjGoring Have a tumblr account? For accidental aRt, yeah. Linking them has been annoying for us too. What's your issue?
Our outreach work in Russia featured in the ASLO bulletin.
@Protohedgehog Ah ok. I was going to protest if you only meant personal webpages.
@Protohedgehog By self-archive are you talking about on personal webpages?
The bulletin contains society news, book reviews, and articles about outreach. Clearly it'd be catastrophic if it fell into the wrong hands.
I was going to blog about it, but what's the point if I can't link to the actual article? Grrrrr.
ASLO Bulletin has a really nice article about one of our Russian collaborators. Too bad it won't be publicly available for a year. #sideeye
@DrInsectivore @Dr_Kalmia I wish I had a dollar for every time I looked at data and wondered "why would you ever X?"
@DrInsectivore @Dr_Kalmia Yeah, that's the worst.
@DrInsectivore @Dr_Kalmia Luckily I do get (perverse?) pleasure out of taking ugly data and making it nice and tidy.
@Dr_Kalmia @DrInsectivore I feel for you. :(
@MAnthonybrowne No way, you look very sciencey and important in that one.
Microplastics transfer pollutants into animal tissue.  featuring @MAnthonybrowne looking very serious.
@_inundata @ropensci Like like like!
@duffy_ma Did anyone suggest @NickCarchedi's swirl package?
How to rescue cars that fall through ice, Siberian style.  HT @AnsonMackay
@amaditalks I would like to play! My username is the same as my twitter handle I think.
Catching a movie at the reopened Senator Theatre.
The Olympic torch makes a trip to the waters of Lake Baikal.
@cgranade I'll interpret this tweet way differently depending on whether you mean Creep by Radiohead or Creep by TLC.
@duffy_ma Can view recently open files? Or do you remember a sentence or phrase that was in it that you could search?
@Le_Science yup. If any community was going to handle it right I would have thought it would be this one, but I guess that was naive.
But this coverup and silencing is shameful. I expected better from this meeting. Holding those hurt by this in the light.
I've moved away from Quakerism in recent years but still have a lot of respect for Quaker communities I've been a part of.
They endangered members of the meeting, and now that it's come out some are still trying to keep it quiet and silence those affected.
[TW] From listserv emails, it appears that Ministry and Counsel of a Quaker meeting I used to attend covered up sexual abuse for decades.
Trigger warning for discussion of sexual abuse in the next few tweets.
@recology_ @_inundata either a normal favorite or a like this favorite, I’m not sure what the difference is.
@_inundata @recology_ @carlystrasser I was about to meta-favorite it but I thought that’d be too much.
@recology_ (that was an empathy-favorite)
@rxnm_ I ask myself this almost daily.
@kwbroman That would be wonderful! Do let me know if you’re in the area. Who’s your collaborator?
@sciencegurlz0 yikes, hope they’re ok.
@recology_ *already
@recology_ It was ready below freezing last week when I went to look for an apartment. Brrrrrr.
I guess I can now mention I’m moving to Pullman, WA in Jan. Stay tuned to find out if living in CA has stripped my ability to handle winter!
@Drew_Lab Made it back to Brooklyn. It was wonderful meeting you and thanks again for inviting me to that talk!
@Le_Science @labroides @sciencegurlz0 @brainyloma I can vouch for it.
Psyched to be catching this lecture with @Drew_Lab.
Love having nerdy friends who can get me into @AMNH for free. Thanks @least_evens.
@AstroKatie I get "a joke", "dead", "not for me", "a cult".
Just touched down at LAX. Thanks @NativeApprops and @MGhydro for the updated info on what was going on.
Just boarded a plane from SB to LAX and now I’m reading on twitter that something’s going on down there again, yikes.
Oh hello SBA, you look familiar. #becauseIwashere18hoursago
@queerscientist Not that I heard, but I was trying to run away as fast as possible.
Giant Christmas tree is already up outside my office. #nothappening #nope
@algaebarnacle You should create an Accidental Art for fieldwork photos.
Jumping red panda.
@Gastove Lovely to meet you, @bookwormonabike!
@Gastove @bookwormonabike Holy cow, I'm trying to think of something that would sound more awesome than this, but I can't. o_O
@kwbroman Ah ok. I have some time during a layover there so I was going to see if you wanted to reprise some Nutcracker hits. Another time.
@kwbroman are you still in Denver by any chance?
For when you really need to blend in while napping.
@amaditalks This has been happening to me too, it needs to stop.
@queerscientist At any rate I'll let you know if I'm going to be there.
@queerscientist As of now I don't have any particular reason to go (nothing to present). But maybe I'll start saving pennies now. :)
@labroides @queerscientist Soo you're saying I shouldn't have listed "all my twitter followers" as a reference on the applications? Oops.
@queerscientist I've never been, but hopefully someday! Why do you ask?
@queerscientist I mean, they've gotta see me as more responsible than the bajillion college students around, right??
@queerscientist Search is going okay. I've submitted a couple applications, hopefully one of them gets approved.
@queerscientist oh that’s right. Well good luck keeping it!
@hspter @Gastove is also just a cool dude I recommend following for data stuff and cute animals, both of which I happen to know you like.
@queerscientist If you’re actually bothering to keep it tidy you’re doing more than a lot of people.
@hspter My pal @Gastove wrote about it:  (@Gastove here I am sharing a thing you wrote for the SECOND time :-P)
@queerscientist As someone currently doing the looking I can tell you it’s not much fun for us either.

@Gastove Ha, yup. The Thing with the Stuff is happening.
@Gastove I'm up in the Pullman/Moscow area.

@EcoEvoProf Ah I used to love doing that! (probably still would, to be honest)
@msanclem congratulations!!!

@hspter OMG
I JUST HAVE SOMETHING IN MY EYE, OKAY??  #SFBatKid
@hspter (meh to saving damsels in distress though)
@hspter stoppp I am about to cry
@ejwillingham Wow. That is NASTY.
#FF @least_evens for interesting and sometimes creepy science videos.
@least_evens That is terrifying.
@QuantEcologyABC My mom did it so she could mail a bunch of fall leaves to me since we don't really have any here.
@BioDataGanache Seems like there ought to be a way, but I have no idea what it is.
@BioDataGanache Hm I have no clue.
@iamdavidbrown What happened to Rothbart?
TIL: to preserve fall leaves' color, iron them between two sheets of wax paper sandwiched between two pieces of old cloth.
I must say I'm pretty thankful for the #Scandal spoilers tonight so I know what I'm getting myself into when I watch this episode.
Better without context: my mom just told me to "think of myself as yeast causing things to ferment."
@ejwillingham @JacquelynGill Gillinghamming
Understanding Lakes Near and Far, by @se_hampton:
@se_hampton Congrats on the piece and also on reaching quadruple-digit tweets. :) @DieterLukas
Sometimes I really wonder what science has against grandmothers.  HT @noamross
@mbeisen
@mbeisen I guess it's a new trend. One that I fully support.
@mbeisen I can't decide which I like more, this or the Russian Army Choir singing Skyfall.
@noamross GRRRRRRR
@algaebarnacle On the other hand it can only get better from here?
@BioDataGanache Presumably it's 50% as kickass as Kick Ass 2?
@cmyeaton I mean it's so easy to accidentally padlock oneself in a duffel bag. Could happen to anyone, really. Especially spies.
@cmyeaton Accident. Right.
@QuantEcologyABC @tpoi Whoa, I WENT to Brown and I never knew it was called that.
@kjohannetsiegel Thanks! We are on twitter too (@accidental__aRt - two underscores).
@scATX "Congratulations" feels weird to say, but it sounds like you will be much happier so CONGRATULATIONS.
@Gastove For some reason I think of tarts as almost always sweet (or y'know, tart. but not savory).
@Gastove Huh, wiki defines a quiche as a tart &amp; says "the categories of 'tart', 'flan', and 'pie' overlap, with no sharp distinctions". Hm.
@Gastove Wait are you saying a quiche is a tart? In the taxonomy of pielike organisms quiche is way more related to pies than tarts IMO.
@Gastove I bet there are some who would argue a quiche is a pie. Depends on your definition of pie I suppose.
@Gastove Mmmm, chess pie. (Though I did have a minute of "uhhh...egg-and-butter pie??")
Organizers of the Ray Kelly protest have written a public statement in @the_herald.  cc @RaniaKhalek @studentactivism
I was right about the reason for the leaves, everyone.
@least_evens Yes! Probably the 24th to 26th.
They're probably reading these tweets. Mom &amp; Dad, what are the leaves for?
My parents mailed me a bag of leaves with no note but I’m guessing this is their way of trying to send fall to SB. :)
@ucfagls @biochembelle This FAQ might also be helpful:
@polesasunder @DistribEcology Ooh, happy birthday!
@BoltBus Aha, thanks!
@BoltBus Nov 24th Baltimore → NYC, then NYC → Baltimore on the 26th. Thanks for looking into it.
@BoltBus I'm trying to book a trip but having no luck. Been checking the site periodically for weeks but there are still no schedules.
@BoltBus Is there a reason you don't have scheds online for trips 2 weeks away &amp; that my calls get disconnected before I can speak to a rep?
Thank goodness for @cbahlai. If I had no one to rant about this Python class with I might actually break something.
@labroides arrrgghhh
It's weird, when my biracial self walks down the street I almost never see anyone gagging. People must be so polite about hiding their gags.
(This being the same Richard Cohen that only last week realized slavery was bad
Honestly I'm kind of tickled that my existence has the power to make Richard Cohen gag.
Richard Cohen's not racist he just thinks interracial couples make "conventional" people gag. GAG.
@MGhydro ...but most of my friends still use old gchat and they just see me as always offline now.
@MGhydro It's ok, I don't like not being able to see who's online at a given moment, but that's not a huge deal...
@MGhydro Yeah, and I may do that. I'm just constantly baffled by what Google thinks are good new features.
That's right, Google, make me invisible to everyone still using old Gchat, that's a great way to get me to adopt Hangouts.
@iamdavidbrown @queerscientist Would it be photos of the art that results from me smashing my computer?
@queerscientist I need all of these things to help me not smash my computer.
No more of this programming midterm tonight or I'll end up smashing everything in a frustrated rage. #breathein #breatheout #bunnies #relax
@davidjayharris @hylopsar That paper is pretty amazing though. In sort of a "wow. such science. much plausible. wow." kind of way.
@davidjayharris @hylopsar Is there a hidden pun in here or are you ruining my immature p-value size/PNAS joke with real science? :-P
@AstroKatie @HopeJahren +100
@LKluber Yeah. Annoying to have to play up sexiness though. @least_evens made a great video without that:
@LKluber "he also wants to help break down stereotypes, to show that scientists aren’t just people, they’re sexy people, too." hmmmm
@hylopsar How fitting that the link is to a PNAS paper.
Paying for tweetbot once wasn’t enough, now I have to pay to upgrade too? Sorry tweetbot but I don’t think I like you that much.
@cbahlai yeah I know what you mean. I've got today off for Veterans Day and am spending the whole day catching up.
@cbahlai how long did the quiz take you?
@cbahlai Yeah I agree on everything. Soon I'm going to be traveling for a few weeks, I don't know how I'll keep up.
@cbahlai no I still have to finish L7 arrghhh
@cbahlai Ugh, I feel like I cannot keep up with this Python class! It's not too hard but it's such a time commitment.
@FreshmanProf So sorry to hear this.
@HopeJahren Okay, I'm breaking out the bright red polish.
.@MHarrisPerry addresses the Ray Kelly at Brown incident and it's brilliant.  #nerdland
@labroides the phrase “I know you can’t see this but…”
@cgranade Maybe it's the sales version of negging *shudder*
@cgranade Well hopefully they'll realize that being judgmental isn't a very good customer service strategy.
@cgranade Argh, car stuff sucks. Hope it gets resolved without too much more hassle.
@cgranade hugs, if you want them
@morgan_id @jebyrnes We are everywhere. @algaebarnacle isn't an alum though (not who you met in the lobby), but she's cool enough to be ;)

@lab_mum You don't.
@labroides yup, Veterans Day.
@RaniaKhalek @onekade It warms my cold, authoritarian, free-speech-hating heart.
@RaniaKhalek @onekade authoritarian pies, too.
@VindalooTitan @onekade Yup.
@onekade @VindalooTitan Yup &amp; they're digging their heels in, pursuing disciplinary action against students instead.
@labroides arrgghhh
@algaebarnacle I'm free tonight after 7:30 or so, also most of the weekend, so whatever works best for you is fine with me.
@algaebarnacle Haha there are trains but they may not be the most convenient. I have a car so I could drive down there.
@algaebarnacle I'm up in Santa Barbara but could come down sometime this weekend if that works for you.
@algaebarnacle oh wow you're so close! If you have a free chunk of time at some point would you want to meet up, or is it super busy there?
@algaebarnacle wait are you in Oxnard?
I'm annoyed that this speech will probably just further entrench Joss Whedon as darling of the nerd progressives.
@CackleofRad but on top of that the white feminists who lambaste women of color for their legit critiques of feminism are all rah rah JW 2/2
@CackleofRad Went on a long rant critiquing use of the word "feminist", which is bad enough coming from a cis white guy 1/2
Joss Whedon, when you say such boneheaded things you make it hard for me to like the cool stuff you've made.
The 4 day delay thing makes me nervous to even back up to my external and then disconnect it. Eep.

Story about the likely fate of environmental group Baikal Wave on @pritheworld today:  #Baikal13
@kjohannetsiegel It's an amazing place. We have a blog too:  New post going up later today.
@kjohannetsiegel How's grad school?
@kjohannetsiegel Yup, based in SB but I've gone to Baikal twice. The plankton are chillin (at least for now, til climate change gets em).
@kjohannetsiegel I'm at the Natl Center for Ecol. Analysis &amp; Synthesis doing data management for a project studying plankton in Lake Baikal.
@kjohannetsiegel Likewise! So you're in the UK now?
@labroides Yay! I know @kjohannetsiegel from undergrad so I can vouch for her coolness.
@BabyWasu oof, prepare to be disgusted.
@Bashir9ist would that it were :(
@selenamarie *hug*
.@hspter's Ignite talk is awesome
@cbahlai Yeah, I'm glad though, feels like I'm really learning stuff.
@cbahlai speaking of which, how's it going for you? I'm midway through L6. It's turning out to be a big time commitment for me but it's fun.
Phrases you never want to hear: "the rest of the process must be tabulated manually using an Excel spreadsheet."
@noamross I even retweeted that when you wrote it! I was so annoyed to see this stupid simile in my timeline yet again earlier this week.
Seriously, it is amateur hour over at the Minneapolis elections department. Someone please help them. Smh.
Copy/pasting Excel sheets to determine mayoral winners should be illegal. I am going to run for mayor on this platform. #Woo2013
This is an ELECTION. Not, like...actually I can't think of any scenario where copy/pasting Excel sheets would be the way to go.
That last retweet...seriously? Wow. Never mind the egregious inefficiency, the possibility (inevitability) of user error is unacceptable.
@RaniaKhalek Does the fact that I blocked this troll make me a totalitarian? Gee I hope so.
@least_evens Or even if it's not!
@LukeWachob @RaniaKhalek I'm not sure I should even respond to this, but: it would be preferable to have accountability for the powerful.
Brown will pursue disciplinary action against those who protested Ray Kelly (shocker).  cc @RaniaKhalek
I read this as "when your heart breaks". Sometimes it does feel that way. @accidental__aRt
Love that @jessleber compares @accidental__aRt to penicillin and Slinkies. :D
@_inundata thanks!
@sharkcait thanks Caitlin!
Accidental aRt got written up by @jessleber of @FastCoExist:
@jessleber Thanks Jessica!
@lab_mum Yayyy glad it turned out :D
@lab_mum Hope it turns out well!
@lab_mum Is it soup time?
@_inundata Ok, check your email. Hope it's helpful.
Someone adapted all of Star Wars in the style of an Icelandic saga in both English and Old Norse.
@_inundata Ok, let me check about the stuff I have in mind and I'll get back to you.
@_inundata Ooh, awesome. Are you looking for data to use as demos or just to use yourself for testing stuff?
@_inundata *perks up ears* can ask what the package is? I might have something but I'd need to check if I can share it.
@queerscientist I hear you. I'm going to be moving soon, not looking forward to it one bit (the process of moving, that is).
"It's like Eggers microwaved California rolls to critique sushi."  via @alexismadrigal
@queerscientist oh no :(
@scATX A student who was there wrote a great op-ed though:
@scATX Also the absolute faith in so-called "reasoned discourse" that must always apparently happen on the oppressors' terms.
@DrMRFrancis but really it's not actually your friend but it is.
My office mate made this piece of accidental aRt:  #rstats
@mrhunsaker @chenghlee Yup. There are so many ways to express this idea without being sexist (so there's no excuse not to).
@kejames This came up yesterday in a conference tweet I saw retweeted. I'm so tired of this framing esp. since many moms *are* scientists.
Everyone who’s awake should be reading @PhuzzieSlippers and @surlyurbanist right now.
Hey @PhuzzieSlippers I think you need this necklace to go with the White Tears mug.
@amaditalks What do they make instead??
"You can use the money you’ll save on tuition to get those daily massages instead." Priorities, she has them.
.@prernagupta (Not to mention it makes you sound elitist and out of touch. Like waaayyyy out of touch. Like on another planet.)
Umm @prernagupta, most Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck. "You probably have enough money for that" is statistically a lie.
Neat, a Brazilian stats website featured @accidental__aRt.  Thanks @JoaoVictor_AC!
@Gastove Absolutely, would love to meet up again.
@Gastove It does indeed! I might even be in town the preceding weekend. Trying to come up at some point in December.
@Gastove Yeah, probably not in the cards for me $$-wise this time, but looks awesome! Are you going?
@Gastove I was just about to tweet specifically at you to make sure you saw this. I try to look out for you, y'know.
Six glorious minutes of corgi puppies being adorable in slow motion.  ht @silverspeakers
@cmyeaton Also similarly, I've never had a woman aggressively and incorrectly 'splain my research to me.
I might be a mom someday and I'm 99% sure that I will not expel my science-brain along with my baby. So don't patronize potential-future-me.
"Well you could substitute any relative." Ok, but you didn't. Because we don't assume dads/uncles/grandfathers don't understand science.
The "explain science like you're talking to your mom" thing speaks volumes about who we assume can be scientists. #ripplesofdoubt
.@Ymodelling Substitute "non-scientists" for "mum" and you've expressed the concept without being sexist. It's not hard.
Sadly I expect this kind of sexism from CERF given the response their lead organizer gave me re their nearly 100% male plenary lineup.
So tired of this BS. Newsflash: moms understand science as well as anyone else. Some are even SCIENTISTS. #CERF2013
@PhuzzieSlippers This is a really powerful piece, thank you for sharing.
@DrInsectivore I'm sitting here trying to pythonify that but it's too early, need more coffee first.
@Dr24hours Whoa, nice!
Okay, fellowship application materials have been sent. Now I will eat leftovers and watch Daria.
@MGhydro Thanks for the offer, I think I'll try one of these command line utilities first.
@AMFeinman @sciencegurlz0 I got it to work one time but couldn't make it combine all the multi-page PDFs I needed it to. Weird.
Thank you, lazyweb. ^_^
@_inundata Sounds perfect, thanks Karthik.
@MGhydro only Reader
Combining PDFs on a Mac: how do I do it? Supposedly Preview should let me but it doesn't. Other tricks?
Accidental aRt is at over 3000 tumblr followers. I seriously have no idea how this happened, but thank you friends who signal-boosted. ^_^
@artologica gasp!
@_inundata @researchremix I can haz one?
@sciencegurlz0 That is pretty fabulous. I love the bottom right one as well.
@SciTriGrrl I did the same thing a couple of weeks ago!
@cbahlai I’m glad you’re doing it too, makes it more fun :)
@cbahlai woot woot, finished!
@Kondrat_Eli С днем рожедения, Лиза!
@srsupp @elitabaldridge Right now @cbahlai  and I are ninjas-in-training :D
@cbahlai cool, will do, thanks
@cbahlai Oh wow, that's impressive. I am still on L3 and need to do this week's problem set.
@cbahlai Are you working on Python stuff this weekend?
@CackleofRad @doc_becca I do Time Machine backups on an external hard drive plus Crashplan+ for off-site.
@doc_becca Might I suggest that now might be a good time to think about backing up your data?
@duffy_ma NICE! Congrats!
Our first gif submission to @accidental__aRt, via @nealkruis:
@FeministGriote aaand now I'm tearing my bedroom up :D
@_inundata Is this like Rap Genius for scholarly articles? Because that sounds awesome.
We are getting such awesome submissions at @accidental__aRt. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 all you nerds :D
@tofu_product what do you think of accidental aRt?
@DistribEcology er @papershipapp. too many similar names!
@DistribEcology I assume you mean @papersapp though it'd be rad if Mendeley collaborated with a Post-Punk Progressive Dutch Garage Pop band.
Pie charts gone wrong:  Of course @kwbroman might ask if there's any such thing as pie charts gone right.
I asked my first SO question, eep! #runsandhides #pleasebegentle #rstats
@labroides but I love mine :(
"It was just a simple gene expression matplot until I tried to increase the line width."  #accidentalaRt #rstats
@davidjayharris @statsforbios Thanks Dave. Yes, we have two underscores.
@cgranade that sucks, I’m sorry :(
@cgranade don't know what happened but I hope you're ok.
Overexcited trick-or-treater slipped and fell on the sidewalk. Mom: are you okay? Kid: yeah, candy’s not okay though.
And now I'm out. Evil printer will have to wait to be vanquished. Going to go observe SB Halloween pandemonium from a bemused distance.
I like this way better. From now on I will never give anyone a call, only a zap. I encourage you all to do the same.
Friend just texted to say I should give him a call when I arrive, but autocorrect changed it to "give me a zap".
@davidjayharris @recology_ Not stats related, but thanks for the tip.
@DrLabRatOry Just wait. It will turn on you.
@DrLabRatOry It's an HP but as far as I'm concerned all wireless printers are equally evil.
@recology_ That reminds me I have one I've been meaning to ask. But it will be my first and I'm scared :-/
Not even an evil wireless printer can dampen my excitement about the fact that @accidental__aRt got &gt;500 tumblr followers today though. o_O
Ugh. I WILL defeat you, printer. But not tonight.
ALSO the box the printer came in is where I stuff plastic bags for use later. So now my room is strewn with plastic bags.
@MGhydro It had better be.
Now I've torn my room apart looking for the printer software CD. Possible I threw it away. Past self, I hate you.
This printer problem is actually ongoing for months. In the end I always decide I didn't really need to scan whatever it was anyway.
@labroides @_inundata Guys. Give me a LITTLE credit here.
@_inundata har har mr. smartypants. (yes I have. so many times.)
Why can you print but not scan, you evil machine??? aaarrghh!!!
@davidjayharris such jerks.
Misandrist animals = best Halloween group costume idea. @avidbiologist and her friends win.
This is really embarrassing you guys.
Wireless printers exist to take me down a notch whenever I start getting too cocky about my computer skills.
@c_anna_da Ah, wasn't aware of that. Still adorable though.
My twitter stream miiiight be biased, but it seems the #1 kids' Halloween costume this year is @Cmdr_Hadfield. That is awesome.
Lovely. MT @accidental__aRt: via @Jakub_Stats: Trying to do contour plots from trait/environmental variables  #rstats

@carlystrasser I think this might be the wrong link unless slideshow forces you to have an account to view other people's slides.
Hey @studentactivism, possibly of interest: "The only thing 'uncivilised' about Ray Kelly's talk...was inviting him"
@jessleber Thx! Short version: I tweeted a graph gone awry, @ErikaMudrak mentioned she'd saved many such pics and had been meaning to post.
@hspter yaayyy! (it's a joint effort with @ErikaMudrak)
@carlystrasser am I hallucinating or was that you I saw earlier?
Oh capitalism.
@sciencegurlz0 Yay!!
Bogology - a blog about bogs. Feeling a Bob Loblaw Law Blog joke coming on...  HT @AnsonMackay
@kwbroman Works for me. PS do you have any wacky R graphs lying around that you might want to submit?
Aand we were featured in @flowingdata data today. *snoopy dance*
Someone is tweeting about @accidental__aRt art in German. I have no idea what "nerdkunst" means but it sounds awesome.
@lab_mum Yup! Happy to send it along. DM me your email?

Since I've just been reminded of it, curried butternut squash soup aka best fall soup ever:
@GrimalkinRN @DrJaneChi @amaditalks Here's a recipe  (my folks' mods are in brackets). Can send text too if you want.
@GrimalkinRN @DrJaneChi @amaditalks Pretty much. Butter, onions, squash, curry powder, stock, apple and apple juice. All gets pureed. YUM.
@DrJaneChi @GrimalkinRN @amaditalks I have a great curried butternut squash soup recipe. The key: add some apple too!
@cgranade Haha, I love that they had to clarify that it wasn't an April Fool's joke.
@scisus Perhaps responses from @cgranade and @hylopsar will be of help:
@cgranade Right now I just need a pdf to send off. But I'll probably put it on github eventually (once I expand my subversiony horizons).
@cgranade @hylopsar thank you both!
I need to update my CV, which is currently still a Word doc. Anyone have a markdown or LaTeX template they particularly like?

@nparmalee Our group met other Baikal scientists (@AnsonMackay @GEASwann @SRoberts_uk) in Siberia thanks to twitter:
@polesasunder Not impossible, but highly annoying. If you know who tweeted you can scroll back through their tweets. It's a pain though.
@polesasunder They're not gone forever, but twitter search only goes back 7-10ish days I think. So yeah, you probably want to storify. :-/
Brought out the Baikal tshirt and charoite earrings for my Baikal presentation at @nceas today.
@polesasunder I don't think so, what makes you think that?
@recology_ @_inundata Thanks guys.
@recology_ what did you use to make these slides? (she asks after spending all evening cursing beamer)
People are seriously talking about Ray Kelly being "silenced". I cannot, I really cannot.
I'm proud of the students &amp; community members who protested and headdesking at all the "but free speech" it's caused.
@_inundata @hspter The title of "First to Learn About an Internet Cat Thing", which comes with an intervention and some new priorities.
Ooh, an opportunity to test Hilary's Law. cc @hspter MT @selenamarie: CATFACE RECOGNITION
@SeeingStructure Thanks for the kind words re: @accidental__aRt. We took some inspiration from WTFViz and ThumbsUpViz so it means a lot.
Ooh, this #accidentalaRt is particularly lovely.  via @accidental__aRt @ErikaMudrak
@labroides Okay! This sounds intriguing...
@hspter I'm going to go ahead and coin Hilary's Law: whenever you find a cat thing on the internet, Hilary already knows about it.
I was just about to tweet at @hspter about the Uber kitten thing but I see she's already on it.
I'm so pleased at the response to @accidental__aRt so far that I need a Drag Race gif to express it.
@Dr_Kalmia I usually go to the library and pick something I think'll be entertaining, last one I listened to was Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo.
@Dr_Kalmia I always enjoy books on CD for solo road trips. It's nice to get drawn into a story on a long drive.
Should you dress in blackface on Halloween?
@sciencegurlz0 hahahahahaha
@SFriedScientist Looks awesome.
@BioDataGanache Trying to make sure I stay employed, eh? Thanks for looking out for me.
A beautiful stained glass-esque #rstats plot.  via @algaebarnacle @accidental__aRt
Someone just sent me data as a csv WITH the associated metadata. Everything is tidy and beautiful. Today is a good day.
@recology_ @accidental__aRt @ErikaMudrak Agreed. We could also link to gists with the code, but again maybe too high a bar for some.
@recology_ @accidental__aRt @ErikaMudrak I'm all for it. Will have to look into getting syntax highlighting on Tumblr.
@algaebarnacle I'm not seeing it, can you try again? We're still figuring everything out.
Accidental aRt is also on twitter: @accidental__aRt. #rstats
@davidjayharris @algaebarnacle @recology_ @Gastove @infotroph feedback also appreciated :)
@davidjayharris @algaebarnacle @recology_ @Gastove @infotroph our accidental #rstats art blog is up!
Do you have images from #rstats graphs gone awry? Submit them to @ErikaMudrak and me at
@cbahlai ... you could still pass the course without completing that one. 2/2
@cbahlai The lecture sequences do take a little time but I bet you could catch up. The 1st assignment deadline has passed but... 1/2
@SFriedScientist Looks really nice! Is there a way to have fixed line lengths on the main page? Even on my 15" screen they're quite long.
@mbeisen @ejwillingham Yours is obviously the scariest.
@ejwillingham Your Halloween twitter name is so good!
Halloween costume idea: Frankenstein Tomtato.
@ejwillingham @mbeisen ...which is amusing because unlike GMOs the tomtato is actually literally a Frankenfood.
@ejwillingham @mbeisen I haven't been following closely but I haven't seen much anti-GMOer freakout about it.
@lavika I feel this logic is flawed. If I were looking for men the last place I'd seek out is somewhere where sexist brogrammers congregate.
@lavika It’s unfortunate that this is one way to narrow down her interests. I hope she has luck finding a path where the community is good.
@lavika It is such a damn shame when our paths have to be determined by self-preservation instead of interests and passions.
@MGhydro Yeah, actually I can't think of any other way to achieve square produce. Might not work so well for, like, grapes though.
@Dr24hours @mbeisen At the very least they'd surely be full of toxins. Or something.
@Lewis_Lab ooh, brilliant. I will try that next time.
@MGhydro maybe? Makes sense. Couldn’t you just put them in a box when they start growing to accomplish that?
Dear science, can the next GMO be an acorn squash that’s easier to cut in half? Thanks in advance.
@cbahlai Let me know if you decide to do it and want to have a little twitter study group :)
@cbahlai I'm trying the edX class because I wanted something a little more comprehensive with deadlines to (hopefully) keep me motivated.
@cbahlai I'm currently trying this:  A while back I did part of Codecademy's Python track and it was fun.
Spent a large chunk of the weekend starting to learn Python. Neatest thing so far was learning that empty sequences are falsy.
.@highlyanne I had a prof in undergrad who made a very big point of correcting students who did this. I appreciated it so much.
Lou Reed :(
@DrRubidium ewwwww
@cbahlai AMAZING
@AWhitTwit I have no clue, but there's only one way to find out!
Welp, it only took an hour of "What do you MEAN, "could not find function X"??!?!!!?" before I noticed my typo. (；&gt;_&lt;)
@AnsonMackay @weganmebb Wow!
@PhuzzieSlippers Haha nope but I can flip some tables with you if you want company. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
@PhuzzieSlippers Sounds like you need a data manager ;-)
Clever: when someone in cardiac arrest calls Sweden's emergency services they send texts to CPR-trained folks nearby.
@infotroph I've got something in the works with @ErikaMudrak. Will let you know when it's ready :)
@Gastove Hedian's pronounced with a long e though :-/
I'm liking the Halloween-themed twitter display name trend. Bonus: mine is also one of my dad's nicknames for me. (hi Dad!)
@nparmalee Ooh I am jealous. Have fun!
Is it just me or is there something sort of cubist about this one? #rstats #accidentalart
@mbeisen Not as long as it isn't you-know-what.
@recology_ @ErikaMudrak I can see it now,  (or something like that).
@ErikaMudrak (we can make it together too of course if you're interested/not too busy)
@recology_ I actually quite like this idea. @ErikaMudrak, would you submit your stuff if I made such a thing?
@least_evens @jasonpbecker I like having an excuse to use the cute little grapefruit knife I got for Christmas once.
@algaebarnacle I think favoriting this tweet jinxed me because I just did it too, and it took my whole computer with it.
@ErikaMudrak @davidjayharris Yeah I might just be a hoarder when it comes to code.
@davidjayharris Nice. Inspired by @ErikaMudrak I'm going to start keeping a folder of weird plots + code to create them.
@RadicalEmu Hahaha brilliant!
@ErikaMudrak ooooh pretty!
@MGhydro I am quite tempted...
Accidental art through failed #rstats plots. I kind of like this.
.@snapdragon830 Just need to get all the non-data-sharers on twitter so they can read the subtweets and be adequately chastened.
New tactic for incentivizing #openscience and #datasharing: viciously subtweet everyone who doesn't share their data.
Gee it sure would be nice to have the raw data though. #sigh #openscience

Speaking of Medicine
@labroides @JacquelynGill @Dr_Kalmia @CackleofRad It makes a good cautionary tale, that's for sure.
@kwbroman hope you get a more satisfactory response than I did.
@kwbroman Will you contact the 2014 organizers? Would be fun to compare the canned responses to the email I got last week.
@kwbroman I feel like I'm having deja vu with the last conference whose lineup I looked at (12 plenary speakers, all men).
Definitely read this as "edible pants". MT @jtotheizzoe: When edible plants turn their defenses on us:
@least_evens @labroides Ooh yes I love Montreal-style bagels. The bagel shop where I worked in HS made them. Delicious.
@labroides Found myself discussing bagels again, this time on Facebook.
@least_evens I'll be there in a month, save some for me.
Boop.
@vsbuffalo sorry for favoriting your trauma.
@cmyeaton good plan
@polesasunder @_inundata Is this what you are looking for:
@Gastove @cgranade Psh, I dunno. Screw this chart, I'm sticking with my preferred method of communication: skywriting.
@cgranade @Gastove And message in a bottle is the timeliest.
@cgranade @Gastove Maybe, in which case fax is highly (infinitely?) practical.
@cgranade @Gastove Meanwhile email costs more and is slower than direct mail.
@Gastove @cgranade Who knew that pigeons were so effective?
@cgranade @Gastove You're welcome :D
.@Gastove @cgranade This one is amusingly meta, or would be if there were a section called "This infographic".

@AmasianV @labroides @Bashir9ist @MarkCC @rachelapaul @Dr24hours I miss Bagel Gourmet Ole so much. *tear*
@labroides Let us take a moment to remember the #grocerystorebagel hashtag. #neverforget
@leafwarbler Sounds like a pretty classist assumption to me.
@DoctorZen @moximer @WhySharksMatter @kejames Me neither. Can't speak for others, but I feel stronger for it.
@labroides @TellDrtell Good call.
@kejames Sharing doubts with others and realizing you're not alone in having those doubts can be hugely powerful (and empowering) IMO.
That picture is pretty amazing though. MT @AWhitTwit: New library jargon that I hope doesn't catch on: Databrarian.

@cgranade @AstroKatie Hm maybe you are right. Grrrrrrrrrrr.
@AstroKatie *Do* we accept it? I sure don't, and I think the only people who can't see how weak and shallow it is are the ones who say it.
.@Gastove was right, views along the 1 did not disappoint.
@kwbroman I don’t think I can anonymize since I’m trying to call attention to the disappointing lack of diversity of his org’s conference.
@sennoma does the context I mentioned make any difference in your opinion?
Is there a Conference Organizer Justifying Lack of Women Speakers bingo card already?
(Er not zero women speakers, zero women plenary speakers.)
@vruba Might be the righteous indignation talking but feel it is justified in the interest of calling out sexism.
(Also if anyone would want to have a guest post on this topic on their blog let me know.)
If context is important, I’m interested in writing about my interactions with the organizer of a conference with zero women speakers.
Bloggers: what’s the etiquette for quoting emails I received? Do I need to ask the person first?
I am exceedingly pleased that all of @Valery_Bomanov’s recent snapchats to me have been photos and videos of Baikal Daphnia.
